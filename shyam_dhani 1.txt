L. \nDangayach and Company. While we confirm that all the related party transactions done by our company in the past have been \nexecuted on Arm’s Length Price and were in compliance with provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 \nas amended and other applicable laws, but we cannot assure you that we could not have achieved \nmore favourable terms had such transactions been entered into with unrelated parties and there \ncan be no assurance that such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, will not have an adverse \neffect on our financial condition and results of operations. For further details in relation to \ntransactions with related parties, please refer to the section entitled “Financial Statement as \nRestated – Annexure 29 – Restated Statement of Related Party Transaction” on page 259-260. \n \nFurther, the raw material consumption contribution of our company is 74.98%, 87.89%, 83.12% and \n73.05% of revenue from operations for the period ended on September 30, 2025 and for the fiscal \nyear ended March 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023 respectively based on restated financial statements. The \ndetails of the same are as under: (Amount in Lakhs) Particulars \nAs on September As on March As on March As on March 31, 2023 \nRaw Material Consumed \n4,782.16 \n10,958.02 \n8,943.69 \n4,963.66 \n% of Raw Material Consumed to Revenue from \nOperations \n74.98% \n87.89% \n83.12% \n73.05% 30, 2025 31, 2025 31, 2024 Revenue from Operations \n6,377.96 \n12,468.04 \n10,760.52 \n6,795.29 \n \nWe may engage additional suppliers to source our products however, our business operations could \nbe adversely affected if suppliers fail to deliver the required quantities on time, adhere to agreed \ncredit terms, or meet prescribed quality and technical specifications. Any such disruption may impact \nour ability to fulfil customer orders and could result in customer loss, thereby materially affecting \nour business, financial condition, and results of operations. \n \nFurther, the availability and pricing of our products may be subject to volatility due to factors beyond \nour control, including fluctuations in global demand and supply, economic and political conditions, \ntransportation or labour unrest, natural disasters, competition, import duties, tariffs, and currency \nexchange rates. Given the inherent uncertainties in estimating the impact of these factors, we cannot \nassure that we will be able to procure adequate supplies in the future on commercially acceptable \nterms. Moreover, our ability to effectively manage relationships with existing or new suppliers, or to \nenter into arrangements with new suppliers on favourable terms, cannot be assured. Any such \ninability may adversely affect our business and financial performance. \n \n2. \nWe may face shortage of Raw Materials because of the seasonal nature of our purchase. Our business is heavily reliant on raw materials sourced from the agricultural industry, which is \nsubject to various external factors, particularly weather and monsoon conditions. The geographical \ndiversity within our country results in differing weather patterns across regions, with some areas \nexperiencing heavy rainfall while others may suffer from drought or inadequate rainfall. Such \nfluctuations in weather, including abnormal monsoons or extreme weather events, can negatively \naffect crop yields, damage crops, and lead to an increase in raw material prices. In these \ncircumstances, we may be forced to purchase lower-quality raw materials to meet production needs, \npotentially increasing production costs as we source from alternative suppliers or regions where \nprices are higher. These disruptions could materially affect our results of operations, financial \ncondition, and cash flows. Page 34 of 402 We primarily procure our raw materials during the harvest season, typically from January to April. \nThese materials are stored in leased cold storage facilities for use throughout the year, including \nduring off-seasons. The details of our Quarterly Purchase for the period ended on September 30, \n2025 and for the fiscal year ended on March 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023 is as follows: (Amount in Lakhs) \nFiscal Year \nQuarters \nTotal Purchase \n% of Total Purchase Q1 \n947.02 \n18.17% \nQ2 \n675.23 \n12.96% \nQ3 \n1,252.40 \n24.03% \nQ4 \n2,337.02 \n44.84% \nTotal \n \n5,211.67 \n100.00% 2022-2023 Q1 \n1,906.91 \n18.42% \nQ2 \n2,270.73 \n21.93% \nQ3 \n2,145.03 \n20.72% \nQ4 \n4,032.17 \n38.94% \nTotal \n \n10,354.84 \n100.00% 2023-2024 Q1 \n2,024.27 \n19.81% \nQ2 \n1,942.16 \n19.01% \nQ3 \n3,008.28 \n29.44% \nQ4 \n3,242.94 \n31.74% \nTotal \n \n10,217.65 \n100% 2024-2025 April 01, 2025 to September 30, 2025 \nQ1 \n2636.60 \n54.40% \nQ2 \n2210.11 \n45.60% \nTotal \n \n4,846.71 \n100% \nNote: Pursuant to the certificate dated December 02, 2025, issued by our Statutory and Peer Review Auditor M/s GL \nDangayach and Company, Chartered Accountants. \n \nWhile demand for our products remains stable throughout the year, the seasonality of raw material \nprocurement introduces significant variability in our operations. This fluctuation in raw material \navailability, coupled with potential price changes, may cause considerable variations in our financial \nperformance across fiscal quarters. \n \nThe imbalance between higher raw material costs and potential downward pressure on product \nprices could place significant strain on our profitability. Furthermore, the inherent seasonality in raw \nmaterial availability exposes us to supply chain vulnerabilities, as we depend on uncontrollable \nfactors like weather conditions and crop performance. Any adverse conditions impacting crop yields \nor raw material quality during our procurement season could have long-lasting effects on our \nfinancial performance, operational efficiency, and competitive position in the market. \n \n3. \nOur products are semi-perishable in nature and the shelf life of our products ranges from 4-18 \nmonths. Inaccurate demand forecasting for our semi-perishable product can result in excess \ninventory and waste which, in turn, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial \ncondition, results of operations and cash flows. Our products are semi-perishable in nature, with self-life ranging from 4 to 18 months. We \nmanufacture a wide variety of spices, including ground spices, whole spices, spice blends, and grocery \nproducts, each with different shelf lives. Specifically, ground and whole spices have shelf lives ranging \nfrom 4 to 12 months, blended spices range from 4 to 18 months, and grocery products range from 6 \nto 12 months. \n \nDue to the semi-perishable nature of our products, there is a risk that inaccurate demand forecasting \nor ineffective inventory management could result in excess inventory. This excess inventory could \nlead to wastage, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, \ncash flows, and reputation. \n \nWhile we have not encountered any material adverse effects from such risks in the past three fiscal \nyears and stub period as certified by the statutory and peer review auditor of our Company M/s G. \nL. Dangayach and Company vide their certificate dated December 02, 2025, there can be no Page 35 of 402 assurance that these risks will not affect our business in the future. As a result, any inaccuracies in \ndemand forecasting or inventory management could have a significant negative impact on our \noperations and financial performance. \n \n4. \nOur Company requires significant amounts of working capital for continued growth. Our inability \nto meet our working capital requirements may have an adverse effect on the results of operations. \nFurther, failure to manage our inventory could have an adverse effect on our sales, profitability, \ncash flow and liquidity. \n \nOur business is working capital intensive and requires a significant amount of working capital for \nsmooth functioning.

G. L. Dangayach \nand Company, chartered accountants. A significant portion of our working capital is utilized towards trade receivables and Inventories. For \nthe period ended on September 30, 2025 and the fiscal year ended on March 31, 2025, 2024 and \n2023, our trade receivables form 17.02%, 16.01%, 14.73% and 22.99% and Inventories form 75.87%, \n75.87%, 78.64% and 68.89% respectively, of total current assets based on audited financial \nstatements. \n \nWe intend to increase our manufacturing capacity to expand our business operations. This may result \nin an increase in the quantum of current assets, particularly trade receivables and inventories. The \nresults of operations of our business are dependent on our ability to effectively manage our inventory \nand stocks. To effectively manage our inventory, we must be able to accurately estimate customer \ndemand and supply requirements and trade inventory accordingly. We estimate our sales based on \nthe forecast, demand and requirements and also on the customer specifications. \n \nNatural disasters such as earthquakes, extreme climatic or weather conditions such as floods or \ndroughts may adversely impact the supply of raw material and local transportation. Should our \nsupply of raw materials be disrupted, we may not be able to procure an alternate source of supply in Page 36 of 402 time to meet the demands of our customers. Such a disruption of supply would materially and \nadversely affect our business, profitability and reputation. In addition, disruptions to the delivery of \nproduct to our customer may occur for reasons such as poor handling, transportation bottlenecks, \nor labour strikes, which could lead to delayed or lost deliveries or damaged products and disrupt \nsupply of these products. An optimal level of inventory is important to our business as it allows us to \nrespond to customer demand effectively. If we overstock inventory, our capital requirements will \nincrease, and we will incur additional financing costs. If we understock inventory, our ability to meet \ncustomer demand and our operating results may be adversely affected. Any mismatch between our \nplanning and actual consumer consumption could lead to potential excess inventory or out-of- stock \nsituations, either of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and \nresults of operation. \n \nWe intend to continue growing by expanding our business operations. This may result in an increase \nin the quantum of current assets, particularly trade receivables. Our inability to maintain sufficient \ncash flow, credit facilities and other sources of funds, in a timely manner, or at all, to meet the \nrequirement of working capital could adversely affect our financial condition and the result of our \noperations. For further details regarding working capital requirement, please refer to the chapters \ntitled “Objects of the Issue” and “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and \nResults of Operation” beginning on pages 101 and 265 respectively. \n \n5. \nOur Company, our Group Company, our Promoters and our Directors other than promoters are \ninvolved in certain legal proceedings. Any adverse decision in such proceedings may render us / \nthem liable to liabilities / penalties and may adversely affect our business and results of operations. \n \nOur Company, our Group Company, our Promoters and Directors other than promoters are involved \nin certain legal proceedings at different levels of adjudication before various courts, tribunals and \nappellate authorities. In the event of adverse rulings in these proceedings or consequent levy of \npenalties by other statutory authorities, our Company or Directors may need to make payments or \nmake provisions for future payments, which may increase expenses and current or contingent \nliabilities and also adversely affect our reputation. \n \nIn the ordinary course of business, our Company, group company, promoters and our directors are \ninvolved in certain legal proceedings, which are pending at varying levels of adjudication at different \nforums. The summary of outstanding matters set out below includes details of civil proceedings, \ncriminal proceedings, tax proceedings, statutory and regulatory actions and other material pending \nlitigation involving our company, directors, promoters and our Group company. \n \nAccording to the materiality policy, any outstanding litigation, other than criminal proceedings, \nstatutory or regulatory actions and taxation matters, is considered material if the monetary amount \nof claim by or against the entity or person in any such pending matter is in excess of ₹ 5,00,000 or if \nan adverse outcome of any such litigation could materially and adversely affect our business, \nprospects, operations, financial position or reputation. \n \nWe cannot assure you that any of the legal proceedings described below will be decided in favour of \nthe company and or directors respectively. Further the amounts claimed in these proceedings have \nbeen disclosed to the extent ascertainable, excluding contingent liabilities and include amounts \nclaimed jointly and severally. Should any new developments arise, such as change in Indian law or \nrulings by appellate courts or tribunals, additional provisions may need to be made by us, the \npromoters, directors and Group company in our respective financial statements, which may \nadversely affect our business, financial condition and reputation. We may incur significant expenses \nand management time in such legal proceedings.

Decreasing the revenues we derive from them could materially \nand adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. We depend on a limited number of customers, which exposes us to a high risk of customer \nconcentration. Our top customers may vary from period to period depending on the demand and \nthus the composition and revenue generated from these customers might change as we continue to \nadd new customers in the normal course of business. Since our business is concentrated among \nrelatively few significant customers, we could experience a reduction in our results of operations, \ncash flows and liquidity if we lose one or more of these customers or the amount of business we \nobtain from them is reduced for any reason, including but not limited on account of any dispute or \ndisqualification. \n \nThe table below sets out our revenue from our largest customers, the top 5 customers and top 10 \ncustomers, on the basis of revenue contribution, for the period ended on September 30, 2025 and \nfor the fiscal year ended on March 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023: (Amount in Lakhs) For the period ended September 30, 2025 \nAs on March 31, 2025 \nAs on March 31, 2024 \nAs on March 31, 2023 Particulars Amount % of Revenue Amount % of Revenue Amount % of Revenue Amount % of Revenue \nLargest Customer \n2,130.71 \n33.41% \n3,791.48 \n30.41% \n2,205.67 \n20.50% \n1,630.80 \n24.00% \nTop 5 Customers \n3,075.65 \n48.22% \n6,108.32 \n48.99% \n5,531.47 \n51.41% \n2,427.27 \n35.72% \nTop 10 Customers \n3,690.55 \n57.86% \n7,031.08 \n56.39% \n6,232.31 \n57.92% \n3,060.95 \n45.05% Page 38 of 402 Any decline in our quality standards, growing competition and any change in the demand for our \nproducts and services by these customers may adversely affect our ability to retain them. We cannot \nassure that we shall generate the same quantum of business, or any business at all, from these \ncustomers, and loss of business from one or more of them may adversely affect our revenues and \nprofitability. However, the composition and revenue generated from these clients might change as \nwe continue to add new clients in the normal course of business. We intend to retain our customers \nby offering solutions to address specific needs in a proactive, cost effective and time efficient manner. \nThis helps us in providing better value to each customer thereby increasing our engagement with our \nnew and existing customer base that presents a substantial opportunity for growth. 7. \nA significant portion of our revenue is generated by General Trade and Modern Trade. 95.71%, \n97.89%, 98.80% and 93.42% of our revenue for the period ended on September 30, 2025 and for \nthe fiscal years ended on March 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023 is generated from these channels. Any \ndisruption or loss of key trade partners could adversely impact on our financial performance. The table below provides a summary of our revenue generated from General Trade and Modern \nTrade for the period ended on September 30, 2025 and the fiscal years ended on March 31, 2025, \n2024 and 2023: (Amount in Lakhs) For the period ended For the Fiscal Year ended on March 31 \n2025 \n2024 \n2023 September 30, 2025 Particulars Amount \n% of Total Revenue \nAmount \n% of Total Revenue \nAmount % of Total Revenue \nAmount % of Total Revenue \nRevenue from General Trade \n3,000.88 \n47.05% \n6,680.65 \n53.58% \n7,289.50 \n67.74% \n6318.64 \n92.99% \nRevenue from Modern Trade \n3,103.58 \n48.66% \n5,524.92 \n44.31% \n3,342.46 \n31.06% \n29.25 \n0.43% \nTotal \n6,104.46 \n95.71% \n12,205.57 \n97.89% \n10631.96 \n98.80% \n6347.89 \n93.42% \nTotal Revenue \n6,377.96 \n100% \n12,468.04 \n100% \n10,760.52 \n100% \n6,795.29 \n100% \nNote: Pursuant to the certificate dated December 02, 2025, issued by our Statutory and Peer Review Auditor M/s GL Dangayach \nand Company, Chartered Accountants. Any disruption in these business relationships, including loss of key trade partners, changes in market \ndynamics, or increased competition, could materially impact on our revenue and profitability. \nAdditionally, factors such as changes in consumer preferences, supply chain disruptions, or \nunfavorable terms of trade with our partners may further affect our business operations. \n \nFurthermore, we do not have long-term contracts with distributors and dealers of the General Trade \nchannel, which makes us vulnerable to potential disruptions in our distribution network. If any key \ndistributor in General Trade reduces or discontinues their business with us, it could adversely affect \nour revenue generation and overall profitability. \n \n8. \nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of Ground Spices, which accounted for \n47.11%, 49.68%, 51.63% and 69.07% of our revenue from operations for the period ended on \nSeptember 30, 2025 and for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. If \nwe are unable to anticipate or respond to changing consumer preferences, maintain consistent \nproduct quality, or if there is a decline in demand for these products, it could adversely impact our \nrevenue and growth prospects. \n \nOur business prospects are closely tied to the demand for our products in the Indian market, where \na significant portion of our revenue comes from sale of Ground Spices. The following table shows the \ncontribution of Ground Spices to our total revenue for the periods indicated: (Amount in Lakhs) For the period ended For the Year ended March 31 \n2025 \n2024 \n2023 September 30, 2025 Particulars Amount \n% of Total Revenue \nAmount \n% of Total Revenue \nAmount \n% of Total Revenue \nAmount % of Total Revenue \nRevenue from Ground Spices \n3,004.86 \n47.11% \n6,193.93 \n49.68% \n5,555.99 \n51.63% \n4,693.84 \n69.07% \nTotal Revenue \n6,377.96 \n100% \n12,468.04 \n100.00% \n10,760.52 \n100.00% \n6,795.29 \n100.00% Page 39 of 402 We cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase our market share for Ground Spices in the \nfuture. The demand for these products is influenced by several factors, including regional tastes, \ncultural preferences, consumer confidence, and evolving trends in the market. Consumer \npreferences are dynamic and can change over time. We cannot assure you that we will be able to \nadapt our product offerings to these changing preferences. A failure to anticipate or respond to shifts \nin consumer tastes could result in reduced demand, lower prices, and an adverse impact on our \nbusiness, financial condition, and cash flows. \n \nWe may also face challenges in introducing new products within more rapidly growing and profitable \ncategories. Any difficulties in expanding our product portfolio or responding to market demands \ncould have a significant negative impact on our financial condition and operational results. We cannot \nassure you that we will be able to sustain our historical sales levels of Ground Spices or reduce our \nreliance on these products. Furthermore, we may need to invest in modernizing our processes or \npackaging to enhance our offerings and remain competitive in the market. \n \n9. \nThe strength of our brand is crucial to our success, and we may not succeed in continuing to \nmaintain and develop our brand. Negative publicity, whether true or not, regarding our products' \nquality, variety, or pricing could harm our reputation and consumer trust. Even false claims or \nmisbranding allegations could severely impact our brand value, potentially leading to a material \nadverse effect on our business, operations, and financial condition. The strength of our “SHYAM” brand is critical to our business success, and any failure to effectively \nmaintain and enhance our brand could adversely impact our performance. Our brand's value is driven \nby various factors, including the quality of our products, the materials used, the effectiveness of our \nmarketing efforts, and public perception. Our expenditure on advertising and sales promotion for the \nperiod ended on September 30, 2025 and the fiscal years ending March 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, \nrepresents the following percentages of total revenue: (Amount in Lakhs) For the period ended For the Fiscal Year ended on ended March 31 \n2025 \n2024 \n2023 September 30, 2025 Particulars Amount \n% of \nRevenue \nAmount \n% of \nRevenue \nAmount \n% of \nRevenue \nAmount \n% of \nRevenue \nAdvertisement Expense \n51.15 \n0.80% \n78.65 \n0.63% \n65.32 \n0.61 % \n30.52 \n0.45 % \nSales Promotion Expense \n61.89 \n0.97% \n144.68 \n1.16% \n104.30 \n0.97 % \n177.63 \n2.61 % \nTotal expense \n113.04 \n1.77% \n223.33 \n1.79% \n169.62 \n1.58 % \n208.15 \n3.06 % \nRevenue from Operations \n6,377.96 \n100.00% 12,468.04 100.00% 10,760.52 100.00% \n6,795.29 \n100.00% \n \nDespite our strong in-house sales and marketing team working alongside media outlets and \nadvertising agencies to boost brand visibility, we cannot guarantee the success of these efforts in \nincreasing sales or solidifying brand perception. Developing, promoting, and consistently positioning \nour brand requires ongoing investments in marketing, and its success will depend on the quality of \nour products and the strength of our customer relationships. \n \nAdditionally, the highly competitive market we operate in means that any failure to maintain and \nstrengthen our brand, particularly with respect to new products or categories, could result in brand \ndilution. Negative publicity, whether true or not, regarding our products' quality, variety, or pricing \ncould harm our reputation and consumer trust. Even false claims or misbranding allegations could \nseverely impact our brand value, potentially leading to a material adverse effect on our business, \noperations, and financial condition. \n \n10. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights from infringement and it could have a material impact on our goodwill, business operations, financial condition and results of \noperations. Our Company has established a brand presence under our brand name “SHYAM” and have taken \nmeasures to safeguard our identity by trademarking our brand logo under the Trademarks Act, 1999. \nWhile we have 8 trademarks registered with the Registrar of Trademarks under the Trade Marks Act, Page 40 of 402 1999, many of our trademark registration applications are pending at various stages. Details \nregarding our trademarks are provided in the chapters titled “Our Business – Intellectual Property” \nand “Government and Other Statutory Approvals – Intellectual Property Related Approvals” on \npages 177-179 and 304-306 respectively. We cannot assure that the registration for pending \napplications will be granted or not. Recently, our application for registration of trademark ‘PAROSO \nSHUDH SWAAD’ under Class 35 (Application No. 5077440) was rejected by the Registrar of \nTrademarks. Further, our 21 trademark applications have been opposed by third parties and \ncurrently, the opposition proceedings are pending before the Registrar of Trademarks. Regarding \ntrademark infringement, there are also outstanding civil material litigations including Everest Food \nProducts Pvt. Ltd. Vs Shyam Dhani Industries Pvt. Ltd. And Ors. [COMIP/178/2021] and Shyam \nDhani Industries vs. Shree Shyam Snacks Food Pvt. Ltd. [CS CCC/0000879/2025]. For further details \nplease see the chapter titled “Outstanding Litigation and Material Developments – Litigation \nInvolving Our Company – Litigation Against our Company” and “Outstanding Litigation and \nMaterial Developments – Litigation Involving Our Promoters – Litigation Against our Promoters” \non pages 296 and 299 respectively. \n \nDespite these efforts, unauthorized use of our brand name or trademarks by companies operating \nin the unorganized sector may negatively impact on our reputation and product sales, potentially \naffecting our financial performance. While we rely on Indian intellectual property laws for protection, \nthese laws may not always be sufficient to prevent infringement. Additionally, the legal framework \ngoverning intellectual property rights in India is evolving and carries inherent uncertainties and risks. \n \nUnauthorized copying or misuse of our intellectual property by third parties could harm our business, \ncash flows, and financial condition. Enforcing our rights may require legal action, which can be time-\nconsuming and uncertain in outcome. Moreover, detecting and addressing such infringements \npromptly may not always be feasible, increasing the risk of damage to our brand and business \noperations. \n \n11. Our company has negative cash flow from operating activity, investing activity and financing activities in the past three years, details of which are given below, sustained negative cash flow \ncould impact on our growth and business. \n \nOur Company has negative Cash flow from operating activity, investing and financing activities in \nsome of the previous year(s) as per the restated financial statement and same are summarized as \nunder: (Amount in Lakhs) For the Fiscal Year ended on March 31 \n2025 \n2024 \n2023 \nCash from operating activities \n153.35 \n(616.11) \n(540.45) \n300.50 \nCash from investing activities \n(75.11) \n(1,380.58) \n(439.67) \n(251.72) \nCash from financing activities \n(111.09) \n2,009.75 \n994.77 \n(61.53) \n \nCash flows of the company are the key indicator which shows adequacy of cash generated from \noperations to meet its capital expenditure, pay dividend, repay loans, make new investments without \navailing financial help from external sources. Inability to generate sufficient cash in future can have \nnegative impact on business and financial operations. For further information, see “Financial \nStatements as Restated” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and \nResults of Operations” beginning on pages 220 and 265 respectively. \n \n12. Any failure in our quality control processes may adversely affect our business, results of operations Particulars \nFor the period ended September 30, 2025 and financial condition. We may face product liability claims and legal proceedings if the quality of \nour products does not meet our customers’ expectations. Our products may, at times, contain quality issues or undetected defects, stemming from flaws in the \nmanufacturing process or issues with the raw materials used in production. While we have \nimplemented quality control processes for both raw materials and finished goods based on internal Page 41 of 402 quality standards, we cannot guarantee that our quality control procedures will always be effective. \nOur Company subject to regular inspection visit from the officials of Food and Safety department for \nchecking of the products manufactured by our Company.

Meeting \nregulatory quality standards is crucial for our business, as deviations from these standards could lead \nto our products being rejected by customers or regulatory authorities. Such instances could damage \nour reputation, market standing, and brand value. If our products are deemed substandard or \ndefective and are returned by customers due to quality complaints, we may be required to take back \nthe products and reimburse the costs paid by our customers. This could strain our relationships with \nlong-standing customers and negatively affect our brand image. Additionally, customers who lose \nconfidence in the quality of our products may refuse to continue purchasing from us, severely \nimpacting our revenue and business operations. We also face the risk of legal proceedings or product \nliability claims arising from defective products sold. While we have processes in place to manage \nquality, we cannot assure that we will not experience material product liability losses in the future. \nDefending against such claims could result in significant legal and other costs. Any product liability \nclaims or quality lapses could adversely impact our reputation, brand image, and financial \nperformance. \n \n13. We operate in markets with intense competition where some of our competitors may have greater scale and resources, enabling them to compete more effectively. This could result in a loss of market \nshare as well as decline in our revenues and profitability. The industry is fragmented, with both organized and unorganized players competing for market \nshare. Key organized competitors include Adani Food Products Private Limited, Ramdev Food Private \nLimited, MDH Masala Private Limited, Baadshah Masala Private Limited, and Everest Food Products \nPrivate Limited. We also compete with publicly listed companies such as NHC Food Limited and \nMadhusudan Masala Limited, along with local unorganized suppliers. The growth of the industry has \nled to the entry of new players with innovative business models, intensifying competition. \n \nIn this competitive landscape, players may lower prices to capture market share, which presents a \nchallenge for established businesses like ours. We face significant competition from other retailers \noffering similar products, with competition centered on factors such as brand recognition, product \nquality, pricing and supply chain efficiency. Increased competition could lead to pricing pressure, Page 42 of 402 reduced profitability, and make It harder to achieve sustainable revenue growth, potentially causing \nus to lose market share. Additionally, competitors may employ aggressive marketing or public \nrelations strategies that could damage our reputation and increase our own marketing costs. Some of our current and potential competitors have substantial advantages, such as longer operating \nhistories, the ability to allocate marketing and sales resources across a broader product portfolio, \nmore established supplier relationships, access to a larger customer base, stronger brand \nrecognition, and greater financial, marketing, and distribution resources. These competitors also \noften possess larger intellectual property portfolios. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to \ncompete successfully against them. \n \n14. The markets in which we operate are influenced by consumers whose tastes and preferences change rapidly, meaning our company may be affected by any disruptions in the industry. \n \nWe manufacture and market spices and grocery products primarily for commercial and household \nuse. Consequently, the markets we operate in are shaped by shifting consumer preferences, evolving \nindustry standards, and ongoing improvements in product quality and variety, often resulting in short \nproduct life cycles. Additionally, we are affected by the spending habits of consumers in India. A \ndecline in demand for our products could lead to significant fluctuations in customer orders and \nincreased pricing pressures.  \n \nIf the technologies or standards we rely on become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial \nacceptance, demand for our products may decrease, leading to lower sales and operating margins. \nOver time, these factors could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of \noperations. \n \n15. Our Company has procured a significant portion of the raw materials from the State of Rajasthan, accounting for 43.72%, 45.48%, 60.09% and 41.46%, of our total purchases for the period ended on \nSeptember 30, 2025, and for the Fiscal Years ended on March 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, \nrespectively. Any adverse developments affecting operations in this region could have a material \nimpact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. \n \nOur Company has procured a significant portion of the raw materials from the State of Rajasthan. \nThe following table presents our procurement of raw materials from Rajasthan during the indicated \nperiods: (Amount in Lakhs) For the period ended September 30, 2025 \n2024-25 \n2023-24 \n2022-23 State Amount % of total Purchase \nAmount \n% of total Purchase \nAmount % of total Purchase Amount % of total Purchase \nTotal Purchases \n4846.71 \n100% \n10,217.65 100.00% 10354.84 \n100.00% 5211.67 100.00% \nRaw material sourced from \nRajasthan \n2,119.23 \n43.72% \n4,646.96 \n45.48% \n6222.48 \n60.09% \n2160.97 \n41.46% Due to the high concentration of raw material supply from Rajasthan, our operations are vulnerable \nto regional and local factors, including economic conditions, weather patterns, natural disasters, \ndemographic shifts, and other unforeseen events. As a result, any significant disruption in social, \npolitical, or economic stability in this region—such as natural calamities, civil unrest, policy changes \nby the state or central government, or increased competition—could adversely affect our business, \nresults of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. While we have not experienced any of these adverse conditions affecting our operations or financial \nperformance in the past, we cannot guarantee that such events will not occur in the future. \n \n16. Failure to comply with, or adapt to changes in safety, health, environmental laws and other relevant regulations could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, and \noperations. Additionally, challenges may arise in renewing or maintaining the statutory and \nregulatory permits and approvals necessary for the continuation of our operations. Page 43 of 402 Our daily manufacturing activities are subject to a broad spectrum of health, safety, and \nenvironmental laws and regulations. Compliance with these regulations is critical to safeguarding the \nwell-being of our employees, protecting the environment, and ensuring the smooth functioning of \nour business. For more information on the key regulations applicable to our business, please refer to \nthe section titled \"Key Industry Regulations and Policies\" beginning on page 180. Non-compliance with these laws and regulations can result in fines, penalties, or litigation, all of \nwhich could negatively impact our business, financial health, and operational results. For instance, \nwe are required to comply with the provisions of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, which \nestablishes scientific standards for food products and governs their manufacture, storage, \ndistribution, and sale to ensure the safety and wholesomeness of food for human consumption. In \nthis regard we have taken following licenses towards food safety and quality standards: ➢ License under FSS Act, 2006 (FSSAI) for Khasra No. 06/1067, Manpura Road, Near Delhi Bypass, Tehsil-Chomu, Jaipur, Rajasthan-303806. \n➢ License under FSS Act, 2006 (FSSAI) for Road Number 12 Vishwakarma Industrial Area, Jaipur, Rajasthan, 302013. \n➢ Certificate Of Authorisation (AGMARK) \n➢ SGS ISO Certificate (ISO 22000:2018) \n➢ Registration-Cum-Membership Certificate, Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority \n \nFailure to comply with licensing requirements or operating without a license under the Food Safety \nand Standards Act may result in legal penalties and fines. \n \nBeyond food safety regulations, we are also bound by laws related to safety, health, and \nenvironmental protection. These include the Environmental Protection Act, 1986, the Air (Prevention \nand Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and \nother regulations set forth by the Ministry of Environment and Pollution Control Boards. Compliance \nwith these environmental laws is crucial to minimizing the impact of our operations on air and water \nquality, as well as to protect ecosystems and public health. Non-compliance could lead to penalties, \nlegal actions, or reputational harm. For further details of the licenses and certifications please see \nthe chapter titled “Government and Other Statutory Approvals” beginning on page 302. \n \nWe have not encountered any such issues in the past we cannot guarantee that such incidents will \nnot occur in the future. Non-compliance in future could result in production disruptions or significant \nincreases in operational costs. \n \nIn addition, we must comply with labor laws concerning minimum wage, working hours, overtime, \nworking conditions, and employee rights. Compliance with these laws incurs costs, and the regulatory \nlandscape may become more stringent over time. \n \nWe recognize the importance of adhering to health, safety, and environmental regulations and strive \nto maintain a culture of compliance within our organization. We have implemented processes and \nprocedures to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Regular monitoring, \ntraining, and internal audits are conducted to identify and address any areas of non-compliance. Any \nnon-compliance or failure to adapt to evolving regulatory requirements could have negative \nconsequences on our business operations, financial condition, and results of operations. \n \n17. Our operating results could be significantly impacted if we are unable to accurately forecast consumer demand for our products or effectively manage our inventory. \n \nWe aim to maintain optimal inventory levels with wholesalers, distributors, and dealers to control \ncosts and manage working capital efficiently. To achieve this, we monitor inventory levels both based \non demand projections and in real-time. Although our manufacturing facility allows us to fulfill large \norders from distributors quickly, any unavailability of products due to high demand or inaccurate \nforecasting could result in lost sales and harm our customer relationships. Page 44 of 402 We manage our inventory by closely tracking current stock levels and keeping a reserve based on \ndemand forecasts. However, if we fail to forecast demand accurately, we may face excess inventory \nor product shortages. Excess inventory could lead to write-offs, discounted sales, and a decrease in \ngross margins, which may also weaken our brand strength. Conversely, a shortage of products could \nprevent us from meeting customer demand, which could negatively impact our business operations \nand financial performance. \n \nInaccurate demand forecasts can also result in an over-supply of products, driving up inventory costs, \nnegatively affecting cash flow, reducing inventory quality, causing shrinkage, and ultimately \ndiminishing margins. Furthermore, some of our raw materials may become outdated and lose their \nnatural properties over time. Any of these factors could affect our business, operations, and financial \ncondition. \n \nFor the period ended on September 30, 2025 and for the Fiscal Years ended on March 31, 2025, 2024 \nand 2023 our inventories valued at ₹ 4515.09 lakhs, ₹ 4,071.69 lakhs, ₹ 2,981.80 lakhs and ₹ 1,121.91 \nLakhs respectively. Additionally, if we fail to efficiently convert purchased inventory into finished \nproducts, we may have to write down the value of our inventory or pay our suppliers without \ngenerating new purchases. This could lead to the need for additional vendor financing and an adverse \nimpact on our income and cash flow. \n \n18.  Our inability to collect receivables from our customers or default in payment by them could result in a reduction of our profits and affect our cash flows. \n \nIn the ordinary course of business, we provide our customers with certain credit facilities as part of \nour payment terms. Though we limit the credit we extend to our customers depending upon their \npayment history and financial condition, we may still experience losses if the customer is unable to \npay. Our inability to collect receivables from our customers in a timely manner or at all could \nadversely affect our working capital cycle and cash flows. For the period ended on September 30, \n2025 and for the Fiscal Year 2025, 2024, and 2023, our trade receivables were ₹ 1028.08 lakhs, ₹ \n859.02 Lakhs, ₹ 561.05 Lakhs and ₹ 382.07 Lakhs respectively, which represented 16.12%, 6.89%, \n5.21% and 5.62% of our Revenues from Operations for such periods, respectively. Macroeconomic \nconditions could result in financial difficulties for our customers, including insolvency or bankruptcy, \npotentially leading to delayed payments, requests for payment modifications, or defaults. These \nsituations could increase our receivables or affect our working capital requirements. An increase in \nbad debts or defaults may compel us to utilize greater amounts of our operating capital and result in \nincreased financing costs, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations and cash flows. \n \nOur ageing analysis is as mentioned in the following table: (Amount in Lakhs) Particulars \nFor the period ended on September 30, 2025 \n2024-25 \n2023-24 \n2022-23 Undisputed - -Considered Good \n \n \n \n \na) From Directors/ Promotors / Promotor Group / Associates / Relative of Directors / Group Companies Less Than 6 months  \n121.64  \n124.10 \n4.08 \n0.29 \nOthers \n- \n- \n1.01 \n- \nTotal (a) \n121.64 \n124.10 \n5.09 \n0.29 \nb) From Other  \n \n \n \n \nLess Than 6 months \n899.76 \n733.80 \n542.27 \n360.64 \n6 Months to 1 Year \n5.93 \n1.12 \n- \n9.04 \n1 Year to 2 Years \n0.75 \n- \n11.08 \n0.36 \n2 Years to 3 Years \n- \n- \n0.05 \n11.74 \nMore than 3 Years \n- \n- \n2.56 \n- \nTotal (b) \n906.44 \n734.92 \n555.96 \n381.78 \nTotal (a + b) \n1028.08 \n859.02 \n561.05 \n382.07 \n \nSuch aged receivables may indicate that customers are experiencing financial difficulties, or that \ndisputes over product quality, delivery terms, or contract fulfillment have not been resolved. The Page 45 of 402 longer these debts remain unpaid, the less likely they are to be collected in full, potentially leading \nto a deterioration in cash flow and liquidity. Additionally, these overdue accounts can increase the \nrisk of customer insolvency, which may result in complete non-recovery of the outstanding amounts. \nTo mitigate these risks, it is essential for the company to evaluate and review its credit policies, \nengage in proactive collection strategies, and consider writing off or providing for long-outstanding \ndebts to ensure financial stability. \n \n19. A major part of our total revenue from operations is generated from the States of Rajasthan and Punjab which accounts for 81.99%, 88.08%, 92.76% and 89.78% respectively, of our total revenue \nfrom operations for the period ended on September 30, 2025 and for the Fiscal Years ended on \nMarch 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023. Any adverse developments affecting our operations in such region, \ncould have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash \nflows. The sale of our products is majorly generated from the state of Rajasthan and Punjab. The following \ntable sets forth our revenue from operations from Rajasthan and Punjab in the periods indicated: (Amount in Lakhs) For the period ended on September 30, 2025 \n2024-25 \n2023-24 \n2022-23 S.  \nNo. \nState Amount % of revenue Amount % of revenue Amount % of revenue Amount % of revenue \n1.  \nRajasthan \n4,089.46 \n64.07% \n8,574.15 \n68.73% \n8,133.45 \n75.59% \n6,103.16 \n89.62% \n2. \nPunjab \n1,143.72 \n17.92% \n2,413.45 \n19.35% \n1,848.74 \n17.17% \n2.33 \n0.03% \nTotal \n5,233.18 \n81.99% \n10,987.60 \n88.08% \n9,982.19 \n92.76% \n6,105.49 \n89.65% \n \nDue to the geographic concentration of the sale of our products in Rajasthan and Punjab, our \noperations are susceptible to local and regional factors, such as economic and weather conditions, \nnatural disasters, demographic changes, and other unforeseen events and circumstances. \nConsequently, any significant social, political or economic disruption, or natural calamities or civil \ndisruptions in this region, or changes in policies of the state or local governments or the government \nof India or adverse developments related to competition in this region, may adversely affect our \nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. While we have not experienced \nany of the above adverse situations that had an adverse impact on our business operations and \nfinancial conditions in the past, we cannot assure you that these adverse situations will not arise in \nthe future. \n \n20. Our company does not manufacture grocery products such as Rice, Poha, Black Salt, and Rock Salt in-house. Instead, we procure these items from third-party suppliers. Any deterioration in product \nquality, delays in delivery, or cost increases could adversely affect our operations and financial \nperformance. \n \nOur company does not have its own manufacturing facility for certain grocery products, including \nRice, Poha, Black Salt, and Rock Salt etc. Instead, we source these items from third-party suppliers. \nAlthough the revenue generated from these products constitutes a relatively small portion of our \ntotal revenue, any decline in product quality, supply delays, or cost increases could adversely affect \nour operations. The details of the revenue from grocery products for the period ended on September \n30, 2025 and the fiscal year ended on March 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023 are as follows: (₹ In Lakhs) For the period ended on For the Fiscal Year ended on March 31, \n2025 \n2024 \n2023 September 30, 2025 Particulars Amount \n% of total revenue \nAmount \n% of total revenue \nAmount \n% of total revenue \nAmount \n% of total revenue \nGrocery Products \n340.79 \n5.34% \n478.92 \n3.84% \n363.86  \n3.38% \n169.90  \n2.51% \n \nWe do not have long-term agreements with these suppliers, and there is no assurance they will \ncontinue working with us. They may also choose to supply to our competitors at more favorable \nterms, potentially impacting our business and market position. Page 46 of 402 Additionally, our reliance on third-party manufacturers exposes us to external risks beyond our \ncontrol. Natural disasters, labor disputes, or operational disruptions at their facilities could disrupt \nour supply chain, increase costs, and affect our profit margins. \n \n21. Our Company is dependent on third party transportation providers for transportation of raw materials. Accordingly, any increase in transportation costs or unavailability of transportation \nservices for our products or transportation strikes may have an adverse effect on our business. Our company is engaged in the manufacturing and processing spices such as Ground Spices, Blend \nSpices and Whole Spices under the brand name “SHYAM”. In addition to our spice offerings, we are \nalso engaged in trading and distribution of Grocery Products such as Black Salt, Rock Salt, Rice, Poha, \nKasuri Methi (Dried Fenugreek) etc. and a diverse range of Herbs and seasonings which includes \nOrgano, Peri Peri, Chilli Flakes, Mixed Herbs, Onion Flakes, Tomato Powder etc.  \n \nWe procure raw materials directly from mandis and other suppliers across India. We have purchased \nraw material from 17 states in India in last three years. The detailed state-wise breakup of the raw \nmaterial purchase of our company from outside Rajasthan as per Restated Financial Statements For \nthe period ended on September 30, 2025 and for the fiscal year ended on March 31, 2025, March 31, \n2024, and 2023 is as follows: (Amount in Lakhs) For the period ended on For the Fiscal Year ended March 31 \n2025 \n2024 \n2023 September 30, 2025 Particulars Amount \n% of Total Purchase \nAmount % of Total Purchase \nAmount % of Total Purchase Amount % of Total Purchase \nPurchase \nfrom \noutside \nRajasthan \n2,727.48 \n56.28 \n5,570.69 \n54.52% \n4,132.36 \n39.91% \n3,050.70 \n58.54% Total Purchase \n4846.71 \n100% \n10,217.65 100.00% 10,354.84 100.00% 5,211.67 100.00% \n \nWe completely depend on third-party transportation and logistics providers for the transportation \nof raw material. We do not have long-term contracts with these providers and use their services on \nan as-needed basis. Any disruption in logistics could hinder our ability to obtain raw materials on \ntime, deteriorate the quality of the products, significantly affecting our business, financial condition, \nand operations. Further details of the expenses related to freight and loading for transportation for \nthe period ended on September 30, 2025 and for the fiscal year ended on March 31, 2025, 2024 and \n2023 are as follows: (Amount in Lakhs) For the period ended on For the Fiscal Year ended March 31 \n2025 \n2024 \n2023 September 30, 2025 Particulars Amount \n% of \nRevenue \nAmount \n% of \nRevenue \nAmount \n% of \nRevenue \nAmount \n% of \nRevenue \nFreight and Loading Charges \n103.09 \n1.62% \n184.24 \n1.48% \n126.20 \n1.17% \n93.31 \n1.37% There is no conflict of interest between the third-party service providers and our Company, our \nPromoters and Promoter Group, our Directors, our KMPs and our Group Company and its directors. \nAdditionally, transportation disruptions due to weather conditions, strikes, lockouts, inadequate \nroad infrastructure, or other events could delay our ability to procure raw materials. Such disruptions \ncould negatively impact our business, financial condition, and operations. Although we have not \nfaced these issues in the past, any future transportation unavailability for these reasons may \nadversely affect our business and financial performance. \n \n22. We are dependent on Third Party Cold Storage providers for storing our raw material and products. Our business relies on third-party cold storage providers for the storage of both our raw materials \nand finished products. This dependency exposes us to various risks related to the performance and \nreliability of these external service providers, which are beyond our direct control. \n \nAny disruptions in their operations—such as equipment malfunctions, power outages, or logistical \nissues—could significantly impact our ability to store raw materials and products safely, potentially Page 47 of 402 compromising their quality and shelf life. Additionally, we have limited control over the security, \nmaintenance, and operational standards at these third-party storage facilities. As a result, there is a \nrisk of damage, loss, or deterioration of our products, which could affect product availability and \ncustomer satisfaction. Although we have not encountered these issues in the past, we cannot \nguarantee that they will not occur in the future. \n \nOur reliance on external cold storage providers also makes us vulnerable to changes in pricing, \ncapacity, and availability of storage space. If storage costs increase or if there is limited capacity to \nmeet our requirements, it could adversely affect our operational costs and inventory management. \nMoreover, any regulatory changes affecting these service providers could introduce additional costs \nor operational disruptions. \n \nOur dependence on external parties for a critical aspect of our supply chain, such as product storage, \nincreases our exposure to unforeseen risks and vulnerabilities. These risks could affect our ability to \nmeet customer demand in a timely manner, maintain the quality of our products, and manage our \noverall operational efficiency that could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, \nand results of operations. \n \n23. Improper handling, processing, or storage of our raw materials or products, along with any spoilage, damage, or actual or perceived contamination, could lead to regulatory actions, harming \nour reputation, and negative impact on our business, operations, and financial health. All the products we manufacture are intended for human consumption and are vulnerable to risks \nsuch as contamination, adulteration, and tampering during production, transportation, or storage. \nWhile we rigorously test our raw materials and finished products at our facilities, we cannot \nguarantee that these quality tests will always be accurate. Additionally, some of our raw materials \nand products need to be stored, handled, and transported under specific temperatures and food \nsafety conditions. Any lapses in production or storage, due to negligence, human error, or other \nfactors, could damage our products and lead to non-compliance with regulatory standards.  \n \nWe at present meet arrangements with the five cold storage houses nearby to our manufacturing \nunit and packing unit for store our raw material and finished goods but our raw material and finished \ngoods are also at our manufacturing unit or our packaging unit during manufacturing, processing, \npackaging and before dispatching. Any contamination, spoilage, damage in our products, could harm \nour reputation, decrease sales, and potentially lead to legal action.  \n \nWe cannot assure you that we will be free from such product liability claims in the future. If any of \nour products are perceived or found to be contaminated, we may face regulatory actions, product \nrecalls, and our reputation, business, operations, and financial standing could suffer. Although we \nstrive to maintain high quality standards, we cannot guarantee that all our products will be of \nconsistent quality, which could harm our brand's value and reduce our sales if associated with \nnegative publicity. \n \n24. There have been discrepancies in filings with the Registrar of Companies (RoC) and other non- compliances under the Companies Act in the past, which may result in penalties. \n \nOur Company has, in the past, experienced prolonged and continuous delays in filing certain forms \nand returns with the RoC, including instances where revisions were made to previously filed forms \nwhich were subsequently rectified by paying additional fees. The details of the delays in a tabular \nformat are mentioned below: S.  \nNo. \nDescription of Form \nDelay ranging No. of instances of delays \n1. \nAOC-4: Financial Statements \n29-31 Days \n2 \n2. \nForm- 23AC: Financial Statements for FY 2010-11, 2012-13 and 2013-14 \n9-37 Days \n3 \n3. \nForm- 2: Return of Allotment \n185 Days \n1 \n4. \nMGT- 7: Annual Return \n10-29 Days \n2 between Page 48 of 402 S.  \nNo. \nDescription of Form \nDelay ranging No. of instances of delays \n5. \nMGT- 14: Filing of Resolutions and agreements to the Registrar \n41-143 Days \n3 \n6. \nCHG- 1: Creation of Charge \n3-76 Days \n8 \n7. \nDPT- 3 \n102 Days \n1 \n8. \nDIR- 12: Appointment of directors \n62 Days  \n1 \n9. \nINC- 27: Conversion  \n16 Days \n1 \n10. \nForm- 20B: Form for filing annual return by a company having a share capital with \nthe Registrar \n10 Days  \n1 between 11. \nPAS- 3: Return of Allotment \n34-69 Days \n2 \n12. \nForm- 66: Form for submission of compliance certificate with the Registrar \n14-39 Days \n2 \n \nWe have filed the necessary forms after paying the required additional fees and following these \nsubmissions, the regulatory authorities approved the delayed filings. As on the date of the filing of \nthis Red Herring Prospectus, we have not received any show-cause notices or penalties from \nregulatory authorities regarding these delays. Further to prevent such issues in the future and ensure \nbetter compliance, our company has proactively appointed a dedicated compliance officer. Ms. \nAmbika Sharma was appointed as the Company Secretary and Compliance Officer in June 2025 to \nhelp reduce instances of non-compliance and delayed filings. \n \nHowever, these delays did not result in any material disruptions to our day-to-day operations or have \na significant adverse impact on our financial performance, it is important to note that any future \npenalties, fines, or regulatory actions related to non-compliance or late filings could negatively affect \nour operations and financial position. Such actions could lead to reputational damage, loss of investor \nconfidence, and potential financial liabilities. Further, there is no assurance that such discrepancies \nwill not occur in the future, and we may still be subject to regulatory actions or penalties, which could \nadversely affect our business operations and financial position. \n \n25. Instances of delays in payment of employee-related statutory dues in the past may expose us to regulatory action, including imposition of penalties. Our Company has, in the past, experienced certain delays in remitting employee-related statutory \ndues, including contributions towards provident fund, gratuity, and bonus, within the timelines \nprescribed under applicable labour laws. While all such dues have subsequently been paid and there \nhas been no continuing default or forfeiture, such delays may be construed as non-compliance with \napplicable statutory requirements. As on the date of this Red Herring Prospectus, no regulatory \nproceedings have been initiated against us in this regard. However, there can be no assurance that \nthe relevant authorities will not initiate inquiries or proceedings or impose penalties for such past \ndelays, which may result in financial impact on our Company. \n \nThe details of the delays for the period ended on September 30, 2025 and in last three Fiscal Years \nare as follows: (Amount in Lakhs) For the period ended September 30, 2025 \nFiscal Year 2024-25 \nFiscal Year 2023-24 \nFiscal Year 2022-23 Particulars No. of Instances of delay \nAmount No. of Instances of delay \nAmount No. of Instances of delay \nAmount No. of Instances of delay \nAmount The \nEmployees \nProvident Fund and \nMiscellaneous \nProvisions Act, 1952 1 \n0.33 \n2 \n0.16 \n14 \n5.30 \n2 \n0.095 Employee \nState \nInsurance Act, 1948 \n1 \n0.04 \n- \n- \n10 \n3.98 \n4 \n0.17 Income Tax Act, 1961 \n(TDS on Salary) \n1 \n0.13 \n3 \n22.08 \n- \n- \n- \n- Goods and Service Tax \n- \n- \n4 \n2.82 \n- \n- \n- \n- We cannot assure you that going forward we will be able to make payment of our statutory dues in \na timely manner or at all, which could result in penal or other regulatory action including payment of \ninterest on the delay in payment of statutory dues, which could adversely affect our business and \nour results of operations and financial condition. Page 49 of 402 26. We have in the past entered into transactions with related parties and may continue to do so in the future.

The capacity utilization at our manufacturing unit is subject to various factors such as timely and \nadequate supply of raw material, uninterrupted power supply, efficient working of machinery and \nequipment and optimal production planning, technical support. While we have obtained a Chartered \nEngineer certificate in relation to the above installed capacity and capacity utilization of our \nmanufacturing unit, future capacity utilization may vary significantly from the estimated production \ncapacities of our manufacturing unit and historical capacity utilization. Under-utilization of our \nmanufacturing capacities, over extended periods, or significant under-utilization in the short-term, \ncould materially and adversely impact our business, growth prospects and future financial \nperformance on account of the constant overhead costs associated with our business. For details on \nour manufacturing capacities, see “Our Business – Capacity Utilization” on page 171.  \n \n28. Competitive pricing pressures may impact on our ability to maintain or raise product prices, potentially leading to a decline in our revenue from product sales, gross margin, and profitability. \nThis could significantly and negatively affect our business, cash flow, financial condition, and \noperational results. \n \nWe may face competitive pricing pressures that could affect our ability to maintain or increase \nproduct prices, potentially leading to a decline in revenue from product sales, gross margin, and \nprofitability. This could have a significant adverse impact on our business, cash flows, financial \ncondition, and operational results. \n \nWhile we maintain consistent pricing across our product categories, competitive actions from rivals—\nsuch as lowering prices for similar products—could reduce our revenue and profits. Moreover, failing \nto adhere to our retail price guidelines could harm our brand value and public perception. \n \n \nTo mitigate pricing pressures, we may seek to reduce raw material costs and enhance production \nefficiency through negotiations with suppliers and by streamlining product designs. However, there \nis no guarantee that we will be able to fully mitigate future pricing pressures or offset price reductions \nthrough improvements in operational efficiency, cost-effective sourcing, new manufacturing \nprocesses, or other cost-cutting initiatives. If we are unable to maintain or improve our margins and \nsales revenue in the face of competitive pricing pressures, our business, financial condition, and \noperational results could be materially and negatively affected. \n \n29. Our lenders have charged over our movable and immovable properties in respect of finance availed by us and the agreements governing our indebtedness contain conditions and restrictions on our \noperations, additional financing and capital structure. Page 51 of 402 We have secured our lenders by creating a charge over our movable and immovable properties in \nrespect of loans / facilities availed by us from banks and financial institutions. The total amounts \noutstanding and payable by us as secured loans were ₹ 4,377.16 Lakhs as on November 30, 2025. In \nthe event we default in repayment of the loans / facilities availed by us and any interest thereof, our \nproperties may be forfeited by lenders, which in turn could have significant adverse effect on \nbusiness, financial condition or results of operations. \n \nUnder our financing arrangements, we are required to obtain the prior, written lender consent for, \namong other matters, changes in our capital structure, formulate a scheme of amalgamation or \nreconstruction and entering into any other borrowing arrangement. Our company has obtained No \nObjection Certificate (“NOC”) from each of our lenders for the proposed IPO of our company vide \ntheir letters dated December 21, 2024 and November 29, 2024 from HDFC Bank Limited and YES \nBank Limited respectively. Further, we are required to maintain certain financial ratios. There can be \nno assurance that we will be able to comply with these financial or other covenants or that we will \nbe able to obtain the consent necessary to take the actions we believe are necessary to operate and \ngrow our business. Our level of existing debt and any new debt that we incur in the future have \nimportant consequences. Any failure to comply with these requirements or other conditions or \ncovenants under our financing agreements that are not waived by our lenders or is not otherwise \ncured by us, may require us to repay the borrowing in whole or part and may include other related \ncosts. Our Company may be forced to sell some or all of its assets or limit our operations. This may \nadversely affect our ability to conduct our business and impair our future growth plans. For further \ninformation, see the chapter titled “Financial Indebtedness” beginning on page 290. \n \nThough these covenants are restrictive to some extent for us, however, it ensures financial discipline, \nwhich would help us in the long run to improve our financial performance. \n \n30. If we are unable to service our debt obligations in a timely manner or to comply with various financial and other covenants and other terms and conditions of our financing agreements, it may \nadversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. \n \nAs of September 30, 2025, our Company had total indebtedness in the form of short term and long-\nterm borrowings of Rs. 4,817.69 Lakhs. Our indebtedness could have several important \nconsequences, including but not limited to the following: \n \n• a portion of our cash flows may be used towards repayment of our existing debt, which will reduce the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general \ncorporate requirements; \n• our ability to obtain additional financing in the future at reasonable terms may be restricted; \n• fluctuations in market interest rates may affect the cost of our borrowings, as some of our indebtedness is at variable interest rates; \n• there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to service our indebtedness or otherwise comply with financial and \nother covenants specified in the financing agreements. \n \nThe Total Borrowings and Debt-to-Equity Ratio of our Company for the period ended on September \n30, 2025 and for the Fiscal Years 2025, 2024 and 2023 as per Restated Financial Statements are set-\nout below: Particulars \nFor the period ended on For the Fiscal Year ended on March 31, September 30, 2025 2025 \n2024 \n2023 \nTotal Borrowings (in Lakhs) \n4,817.69 \n4,723.52 \n2,445.39 \n1,275.21 \nDebt-Equity Ratio \n1.73 \n2.00 \n1.57 \n1.38 \n \nMany of our financing agreements also include various conditions and covenants that require us to \nobtain consent of the lenders prior to carrying out certain activities or entering into certain \ntransactions. Certain covenants in these agreements require us to obtain approval/permission from Page 52 of 402 our lenders in certain conditions. In the event of default or the breach of certain covenants, our \nlender has the option to make the entire outstanding amount payable immediately. There can be no \nassurance that we will be able to comply with these financial or other covenants or that we will be \nable to obtain consents necessary to take the actions that we believe are required to operate and \ngrow our business. For further details in this regard, please refer “Financial Indebtedness” beginning \non page 290. \n \n31. Our business is dependent on our manufacturing Units, and we are subject to certain risks in our manufacturing process. Any slowdown or shutdown in our manufacturing operations could have \nan adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our manufacturing unit is situated at Khasra No. 06/1067 Manpura Road, Jatawali, near the Delhi \nbypass, Tehsil – Chomu, Jaipur, Rajasthan and is subject to certain operating risks, such as the \nbreakdown or failure of equipment, power supply or processes, performance below expected levels \nof efficiency, obsolescence of equipment or machinery, labour disputes, natural disasters, industrial \naccidents, and the need to comply with the directives of relevant government and regulatory \nauthorities. \n \nOur business is dependent upon our ability to manage our manufacturing unit and run them at \ncertain utilization levels, which are subject to various operating risks, including those beyond our \ncontrol, such as the breakdown and failure of equipment, industrial accidents, labour disputes or \nshortage of labour, severe weather conditions and natural disasters. While there have been no such \ninstances in the past, any significant malfunction or breakdown of our machinery, our equipment, \nour IT systems or any other part of our systems associated with manufacturing activities (together, \nour “Manufacturing Assets”) may entail significant repair and maintenance costs and cause delays \nin our operations. If we are unable to repair Manufacturing Assets in a timely manner or at all, our \noperations may need to be suspended until we procure the appropriate Manufacturing Assets to \nreplace the same and we cannot assure you that the new Manufacturing Assets will be procured \nand/or integrated in a timely manner. In addition, we may be required to carry out planned \nshutdowns of our facilities for maintenance, statutory inspections, testing and equipment upgrades. \n \nAs our customers rely significantly on the timely delivery of our products, uninterrupted power \nsupply, supply of trained and skilled manpower, availability of raw materials and our ability to carry \non interruption-free production of our products is critical to our business. Further, our electricity \nrequirements for our manufacturing units are directly sourced from local utilities. We cannot assure \nyou that we will successfully be able to prevent disruptions in our manufacturing processes in case \nof non-availability of an adequate supply of power. While we have backup systems, such as DG Sets, \nand keep spare parts on hand, we cannot guarantee that replacements will be available or of \nequivalent quality, which could lead to extended downtime. This may impact on our manufacturing \ncapacity and delay fulfilling customer orders. \n \nFurther, we may be subject to manufacturing disruptions due to contraventions by us of any of the \nconditions of our regulatory approvals, which may require our manufacturing facilities to cease, or \nlimit, production until the disputes concerning such approvals are resolved. While we have not \nexperienced such instances, in the event such instances occur in the future, it may have an adverse \neffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n \n32. The objects of the Issue include orders for plant and machinery which have been placed. In the event of any delay in delivery of such orders, the proposed schedule of implementation and \ndeployment of the Net Proceeds may be extended or may vary. \n \nOur Company has placed orders for plant and machinery worth ₹ 163.06 Lakhs as part of its planned \noperations. However, in the event of any delay in the delivery of such orders, the proposed schedule \nfor the implementation and deployment of the Net Proceeds may be extended or may vary. This \ncould impact the Company's ability to execute its business plans as initially projected, potentially \naffecting revenue generation, cost management, and overall timelines. Investors should be aware Page 53 of 402 that any delay in the delivery of critical assets could result in unforeseen operational challenges or a \nshift in the Company's strategic deployment of the Net Proceeds. \n \n33. Our operations may be adversely affected in case of industrial accidents at our manufacturing unit. Usage of machinery, handling materials by labour during manufacturing process or otherwise, lifting \nof materials by humans, etc. may result in accidents, which could cause injury to our labour, \nemployees, other persons on the site and could also damage our properties thereby affecting our \noperations. While we have not experienced such incidents in past, we cannot guarantee that they \nwill not occur in the future. The occurrence of accidents could hamper our manufacturing process \nand consequently affect our profitability. \n \n34. We have not made any alternate arrangements for meeting our capital requirements for the Objects of the Issue. Further we have not identified any alternate source of financing the ‘Objects \nof the Issue’. Any shortfall in raising / meeting the same could adversely affect our growth plans, \noperations and financial performance. \n \nAs on date, we have not made any alternate arrangements for meeting our capital requirements for \nthe Objects of the Issue. We meet our capital requirements through our bank finances, owned funds \nand internal accruals. Any shortfall in our net owned funds, internal accruals and our inability to raise \ndebt in future would result in us being unable to meet our capital requirements, which in turn will \nnegatively affect our financial condition and the results of operations. Further, we have not identified \nany alternate source of funding and hence any failure or delay on our part to raise money from this \nIssue or any shortfall in the Issue proceeds may delay the implementation schedule and could \nadversely affect our growth plans. For further details, please refer to the chapter titled “Objects of \nthe Issue” beginning on page 101. \n \n35. Within the parameters as mentioned in the chapter titled ‘Objects of the Issue’ beginning on page 101, our Company’s management will have flexibility in applying the proceeds of this Issue. The \nfund requirement and deployment mentioned in the Objects of this Issue have not been appraised \nby any bank or financial institution. \n \nWe intend to use Issue Proceeds towards Purchase of machineries for Funding the incremental \nWorking Capital Requirements of our Company, Repayment/Pre-payment, in full or in part, of certain \noutstanding borrowings availed by our company, Brand Creation and Marketing Expenses, Capital \nExpenditure towards the purchase of new additional machineries to be installed at the existing \nmanufacturing unit, Purchase and installation of Solar Rooftop Plant at the existing manufacturing \nunit, General Corporate Purposes and to meet Issue expenses. We intend to deploy the Net Issue \nProceeds in FY 2025-26 and FY 2026-27. Such deployment is based on certain assumptions and \nstrategy which our Company believes to implement in near future. The funds raised from the Issue \nmay remain idle on account of change in assumptions, market conditions, strategy of our Company, \netc., For further details on the use of the Issue Proceeds, please refer chapter titled “Objects of the \nIssue” beginning on page 101. \n \nThe deployment of funds for the purposes described above is at the discretion of our Company’s \nBoard of Directors.

However, in accordance with Section 27 of \nthe Companies Act, 2013, a company shall not vary the objects of the Issue without our Company \nbeing authorised to do so by our shareholders by way of special resolution and other compliances in \nthis regard. \n \n36. We have certain contingent liabilities that have not been provided for in our financial statements, which if they materialise, may adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and results of \noperations. \n \nAs of September 30, 2025, we had ₹ 8.96 Lakhs of contingent liabilities that had not been provided \nfor. A summary table of our contingent liabilities as of September 30, 2025, as disclosed in the chapter \ntitled “Financial Statements as Restated” is set forth below: (Amount in Lakhs) \nS.

Any \nor all of these contingent liabilities may become actual liabilities. In the event that any of our \ncontingent liabilities become actual liabilities, our business, financial condition and results of \noperations may be adversely affected. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will not incur \nsimilar or increased levels of contingent liabilities in the current Financial Year or in the future. \n \n37. Our Registered and Corporate Office is taken on lease from the member of our promoter group. Disruption of our rights as lessee or termination of the agreements with our lessor (Member of our \nPromoter Group) may adversely impact our operations and, consequently, our business, financial \ncondition and results of operations. \n \nAs on the date of this Red Herring Prospectus, our Registered and Corporate Office is located on \npremises which is not owned by us and has been obtained on lease basis from the member of our \npromoter group. For details on properties taken on lease / rent by us please refer to the heading \ntitled “Our Business - Properties” on page 176-177.  \n \nThe agreements are renewable on mutually agreed terms.

While the related party lease or rent payments done by our Company \nare on Arm’s Length Price and our Company is in compliance with the provisions of Companies Act, \n2013. We may continue to pay the lease or rent amounts to our related parties in future also but \nthere can be no assurance that such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, will not have an \nadverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or that we could not have achieved \nmore favorable terms if such transactions had not been entered into with related parties. \nAdditionally, any future increments in our lease or rent payments to our related parties could \npotentially involve conflicts of interest.

Our Promoters and two members of our Promoter Group have provided personal guarantees for secured loan facilities obtained by us, and any failure or default by us to repay such loans could \ntrigger repayment obligations on our Promoters and Promoter Group, which may also impact our \nPromoter’s ability to effectively service its obligations as our Promoter and thereby, adversely \nimpact our business and operations. \n \nAs of November 30, 2025, the secured borrowings aggregating to ₹ 4,377.16 lakhs have been \nsanctioned by scheduled commercial banks to our Company. Our promoters, namely Mr. Ramawtar \nAgarwal, Mrs. Mamta Devi Agarwal and Mr. Vithal Agarwal and member of the Promoter Group Ms. \nKhushi Agarwal and Shyam Dhani Industries have provided their personal guarantee in securing these \nborrowings.

As a result, any such demand may materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, \nfinancial condition, and results of operations. For further information on unsecured loans relating to \nour business and operations, see “Financial Indebtedness” beginning on page 290. \n \n40. Our operations could be significantly impacted by strikes, work stoppages, or increased wage amount (In Months) demands from our employees. Any disputes with our workforce may negatively affect our business \nand operational outcomes. \n \nWe cannot guarantee that our employees will not join labour unions in the future and as a result we \nmay experience disruptions in our operations due to disputes or other problems with our workforce. \nEfforts by our employees to modify compensation and other terms of employment may also divert \nmanagement’s attention and increase operating expenses. While we have not experienced such \nincidents in past, we cannot guarantee that they will not occur in the future. The occurrence such \nincidents could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n \n41. Our business depends upon the capabilities and performance of our Promoters, Key Managerial Personnel and Senior Management that will be crucial to determining the success and growth of \nour company. \n \nOur success heavily relies on the expertise and experience of our Promoters, Directors, and Senior \nManagement, and our ability to attract and retain skilled employees. The departure of any of our \nKMPs, Senior Management, or our inability to attract and retain them, as well as other skilled \npersonnel, could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and operational results. We \ndepend on the management capabilities and guidance of our promoters to develop business \nstrategies, oversee their successful implementation, and address future challenges. Our future \nsuccess depends on our ability to retain our management team. If any Promoter, KMP or senior \nmanagement member chooses to leave their position, finding a suitable replacement may be \ndifficult, which could disrupt the smooth operation of our business. \n \nAdditionally, the departure of a Senior Management employee could require significant time to \nrecruit and train a replacement, and we may face increased compensation costs due to industry \ncompetition to attract and retain the skilled talent necessary for our business. Losing the services of \nsuch Senior Management could negatively affect our business, operational results, cash flow, and \nfinancial performance. \n \n42. Employee misconduct, mistakes, or fraudulent actions could expose us to business risks or financial losses, potentially negatively impacting our business prospects, operational results, and financial \ncondition. \n \nThe company faces the risk of employee misconduct, errors, or fraud, which could lead to significant \nlosses, legal penalties for violations, and damage to its reputation. Such misconduct may include \nbreaches of confidentiality, misappropriation of funds, concealment of unauthorized activities, and \nfailure to adhere to operational standards and processes. Detecting or preventing these actions is \nnot always possible, and the measures taken to curb such unethical behavior may not always be \neffective. Additionally, losses resulting from employee misconduct or mismanagement of petty cash \nand advances may be unrecoverable, potentially leading to write-offs that could negatively impact \noperational results. Our company may also make errors that could expose us to claims of negligence Page 57 of 402 or regulatory actions, which could harm our reputation, business prospects, financial condition, and \noperational performance. \n \n43. The modernization and upgrading of technology could make the current machinery and technology outdated and no longer useful. Change is inevitable, and modernization along with technology upgrades is crucial to deliver \nimproved services to customers. Upgrading technology could render our current machinery and \nsystems obsolete, necessitating significant capital investment to adopt new technologies or upgrade \nexisting equipment. The costs associated with such upgrades and modernization could have a \nconsiderable impact on our finances and operations. Additionally, implementing new processes \nwould require substantial capital expenditures, potentially negatively affecting our business and \nfinancial condition. \n \n44. We are obligated to maintain various licenses, approvals, registrations, consents, and permits as part of our regular business activities. Failure to obtain the necessary approvals may lead to non-\ncompliance, which could negatively impact our business operations, financial condition, \nperformance, and future prospects. We require various licenses, approvals, registrations, consents, and permits to operate our business. \nAdditionally, we must periodically apply for approvals, including the renewal of expiring ones, as part \nof the normal course of business. When our company transitioned to a Public Limited Company, we \nchanged our name from Shyam Dhani Industries Private Limited to Shyam Dhani Industries Limited, \nas approved by our shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting held on August 20, 2024. We \nhave updated this change in several of our approvals, licenses, and registrations, but some are still in \nthe process of being updated. \n \nIf we fail to obtain these necessary approvals and permits, it could negatively affect our business, \noperations, cash flows, and financial condition. Delays or failures in obtaining, maintaining, or \nrenewing the required licenses and approvals may disrupt our business operations, which could have \na harmful impact on our financial health and performance. Although we have secured key approvals \nneeded for our business, we are still waiting for the grant or renewal of certain essential approvals. \n \nMoreover, government approvals and licenses often come with various conditions, such as \ncompliance with emission standards and regular monitoring requirements, which can be \nburdensome and costly. We may face significant expenses, including clean-up or remediation costs, \nfines, and civil or criminal penalties, due to violations of environmental or health and safety laws, \nwhich could materially affect our business or financial situation. We cannot guarantee that the \napprovals, licenses, registrations, and permits granted to us will not be suspended or revoked due to \nnon-compliance or regulatory actions. Any failure to renew expired approvals, or to apply for, obtain, \nor maintain the required permits, or if any approvals are suspended or revoked, could seriously \ndisrupt our operations. For more details, please refer to the section \"Government and Statutory \nApprovals\" beginning on page 302, which includes information on approvals currently pending with \nrelevant authorities. \n \n45. We may not have sufficient insurance coverage to cover all possible losses. Our operations are inherently risky, with potential for personal injury, loss of life, damage to \nproperty, plant and machinery, and environmental harm. We are also exposed to various risks such \nas fire, theft, flooding, earthquakes, and terrorism. To mitigate these risks, we maintain insurance \ncoverage in amounts we deem commercially appropriate, including coverage for damage, loss of \nprofit, business interruption, marine inland transit, and third-party liability related to our assets. Our \ninsured assets include property, plant and equipment, furniture, fixtures, fittings, inventory, and \nmore. Over the past three years, we have not encountered any instances of underinsurance, where \nour coverage did not meet the required insured value for our operations. However, we cannot \nguarantee that our current or future insurance will fully cover all potential losses or liabilities, \nparticularly in cases where the loss is difficult to quantify. While we have not experienced such issues Page 58 of 402 in the past three years, there is no assurance that in the future, our losses may not significantly \nexceed our insurance coverage, or that certain losses may not be recoverable through insurance. As \na result, our business, financial condition, and operational performance could be materially and \nadversely impacted.

Our insured assets primarily consist of property, plant \n& equipment, furniture, fixtures and fittings, inventory, etc. In the past three years, there has been \nno instances of under insurance i.e., where our insurance cover did not adequately cover the insured \nvalue required for our operations. However, there can be no assurance that our current and future \ninsurance will adequately cover all losses or liabilities that may arise from our operations, including, \nbut not limited to, when the loss suffered is not easily quantifiable. While we have not had any such \ninstance in the past three years, there can be no assurance that in the future our losses would not \nsignificantly exceed our insurance coverage or may not be recoverable through insurance and \nconsequently our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and \nadversely affected. \n \n46. Industry information included in this Red Herring Prospectus has been derived from publicly available industry reports and/or websites. There can be no assurance that such third–party \nstatistical, financial and other industry information is either complete or accurate. \n \nWe have relied on the information from various publicly available industry reports and/or websites \nfor purposes of inclusion of such information in this Prospectus. These reports are subject to various \nlimitations and based upon certain assumptions that are subjective in nature. We have not \nindependently verified data from such industry reports and other sources. Although the data may be \nconsidered to be reliable, their accuracy, completeness and underlying assumptions are not \nguaranteed, and their dependability cannot be assured. While we have taken reasonable care in the \nreproduction of the information, the information has not been prepared or independently verified \nby us or any of our respective affiliates or advisors and, therefore, we make no representation or \nwarranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of such facts and statistics. Due to \npossibly flawed or ineffective collection methods or discrepancies between published information Page 59 of 402 and market practice and other problems, the statistics herein may be inaccurate or may not be \ncomparable to statistics produced for other economies and should not be unduly relied upon. \nFurther, there is no assurance that they are stated or compiled on the same basis or with the same \ndegree of accuracy as may be the case elsewhere. \n \n47. Our inability to successfully implement some or all our business strategies in a timely manner or at all could have an adverse effect on our business. As part of our strategy aimed towards business growth and improvement of market position, we \nintend to implement several business strategies, which include: \n \n1. Continued focus on diversified business model \n2. Increase in advertisement and marketing activities \n3. Investment in improving product quality \n \nFor further information, see “Business – Our Business Strategies” on page 161-163. \n \nOur strategies may not succeed due to various factors, such as our inability to enhance manufacturing \ncapacities, failure to adapt to market preferences and trends, or failure to upgrade infrastructure, \nmachinery, automation, equipment, and technology to meet changing demand. Our inability to \nrespond to regular competition, and other operational and management difficulties. Even though we \nhave successfully executed our business strategies in the past, there is no guarantee that we can \nimplement the same on time and within the estimated budget going forward, or that we will be able \nto meet the expectations of our targeted customers. Any failure on our part to implement our \nstrategy due to many reasons as attributed aforesaid could be detrimental to our long-term business \noutlook and our growth prospects and may materially affect our business, financial condition and \nresult of operations. \n \n48. The average cost of acquisition of Equity Shares by our Promoters could be lower than the floor price. \n \nOur Promoters average cost of acquisition of Equity Shares in our Company may be lower than the \nFloor Price of the Price Band as may be decided by the Company in consultation with the Book \nRunning Lead Manager. For further details regarding average cost of acquisition of Equity Shares by \nour Promoters in our Company and build-up of Equity Shares by our Promoters in our Company, \nplease refer chapter titled “Summary of Issue Document – Average Cost of Acquisition of Shares for \nPromoters and Selling Shareholders” on page 30. \n \n49. In addition to standard remuneration or benefits and reimbursement of expenses, some of our Promoters, Directors and key managerial personnel are interested in our Company to the extent of \ntheir shareholding, dividend entitlement and lease rent received, in our Company. \n \nOur Promoters, Directors and Key Managerial Personnel are interested in our Company to the extent \nof remuneration paid to them for services rendered and reimbursement of expenses payable to \nthem. Further, some of our Promoters, Directors and Key Managerial Personnel may also be \ninterested to the extent of their shareholding, dividend entitlement and lease rental in our Company. \nFor details on interest of our Promoters in lease rental, refer “Risk Factor No. 37 - Our Registered \nand Corporate Office is taken on lease from the member of our promoter group. Disruption of our \nrights as lessee or termination of the agreements with our lessor (Member of our Promoter Group) \nmay adversely impact our operations and, consequently, our business, financial condition and \nresults of operations” and for other information, see “Capital Structure”, “Our Management” and \n“Financial Statements as Restated” beginning on pages 55-56, 85, 193 and 220 respectively. \n \n50. We have not entered into any formal arrangement for technical support service for maintenance and smooth functioning of our equipments and machineries, which may affect our performance. Page 60 of 402 Our manufacturing processes involve daily use of technical equipment’s and machineries. They \nrequire periodic maintenance checks and technical support in the event of technical breakdown or \nmalfunctioning. Our Company has not entered into any formal technical support service agreements \nwith a competent third-party vendor. However, Company has an in-house team for maintenance and \nadvancement of machinery. Our failure to reduce the downtime in as such events occur may \nadversely affect our productivity, business and results of operations. \n \n51. There is no monitoring agency appointed by our Company and the deployment of funds are at the discretion of our Management and our Board of Directors, though it shall be monitored by the Audit \nCommittee. \n \nAs per SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2018 appointment of monitoring agency is required only for Issue size \nabove ₹ 5,000 Lakhs. Since the Issue size below ₹ 5,000 Lakhs, our Company has not appointed any \nmonitoring agency for this Issue. However, as per Section 177 of the Companies Act, 2013, the Audit \nCommittee of our Company, would be monitoring the utilization of the proceeds of the Issue and our \ncompany shall furnish a certificate of the statutory auditor pursuant to regulation 262 (5) of the SEBI \nICDR Regulations, 2018 (as amended) for utilization of money raised through the public issue to SME \nexchange while filing the quarterly financial results, till the issue proceeds are fully utilized.   \n \nOur one of the objects of the issue to raise fund to meet our incremental working capital \nrequirements in excess of 5 crores, therefore pursuant to regulation 262 (6) of the SEBI ICDR \nRegulations (as amended) our Company shall furnish to the Stock Exchange a certificate of statutory \nauditor for use of funds as working capital in the same format as disclosed in this RHP till the proceeds \nraised for the such objects are fully utilized while filing the quarterly financial results. \n \n52. Our Promoters will continue jointly to retain majority control over our Company after the Issue, which will allow them to determine the outcome of matters submitted to shareholders for \napproval. After completion of the Issue, our Promoters will collectively own [●] % of the Equity Shares of face \nvalue of ₹ 10 each. As a result, our Promoters will be able to exercise a significant degree of influence \nover us and will be able to control the outcome of any proposal that can be approved by a majority \nshareholder vote, including, the election of members to our Board, in accordance with the Companies \nAct and our Articles of Association. Such a concentration of ownership may also have the effect of \ndelaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of our Company. \n \nIn addition, our Promoters will continue to have the ability to cause us to take actions that are not \nin, or may conflict with, our interests or the interests of some or all of our creditors or minority \nshareholders, and we cannot assure you that such actions will not have an adverse effect on our \nfuture financial performance or the price of our Equity Shares. \n \n53. Our ability to pay dividends in the future may depend upon our future revenues, profits, financial condition, cash flows, working capital requirements, capital expenditures and restrictive covenants \nin our financing arrangements. \n \nWe may retain all our future earnings, if any, for use in the operations and expansion of our business. \nAs a result, we may not declare dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination as to \nthe declaration and payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will \ndepend on factors that our Board of Directors deem relevant, including among others, our results of \noperations, financial condition, cash requirements, business prospects. Accordingly, realization of a \ngain on shareholders investments may largely depend upon the appreciation of the price of our \nEquity Shares. There can be no assurance that our Equity Shares will appreciate in value. For details \nof our dividend history, see “Dividend Policy” on page 219. \n \n54. Our future funds requirements, in the form of issue of capital or securities and/or loans taken by us, may be prejudicial to the interest of the shareholders depending upon the terms on which they \nare eventually raised. Page 61 of 402 We may require additional capital from time to time depending on our business needs. Any issue of \nshares or convertible securities would dilute the shareholding of the existing shareholders and such \nissuance may be done on terms and conditions, which may not be favorable to the then existing \nshareholders. If such funds are raised in the form of loans or debt, then it may substantially increase \nour interest burden and decrease our cash flows, thus prejudicially affecting our profitability and \nability to pay dividends to our shareholders. \n \n55. All of our Directors do not have any prior experience of being a director in any other listed company in India. Our current Board comprises of 6 directors which includes Chairman and Managing Director, 2 \nWhole-Time Director, 2 non-executive independent directors and 1 non-executive non-independent \ndirectors. All of our board of directors do not have any prior experience of being a director in any \nother listed company in India. While our Board members are qualified and have relevant experience \nin their respective field, not having any prior experience as being a director in any other listed \ncompany in India may present some potential challenges to our Company ineffectively meeting with \ngood corporate governance norms and practices. Additionally, having lack of such experience \namongst the board may impact our Company's credibility and reputation among the investors and \nother stakeholders. For further details, please see chapter titled “Our Management” beginning on \npage 193. \n \nIssue Specific Risks \n \n56. Subsequent to the listing of the Equity Shares, we may be subject to surveillance measures, such as the Additional Surveillance Measures and the Graded Surveillance Measures by the Stock \nExchanges in order to enhance the integrity of the market and safeguard the interest of investors. Subsequent to the listing of the Equity Shares, we may be subject to Additional Surveillance \nMeasures (“ASM”) and Graded Surveillance Measures (“GSM”) by the Stock Exchange. These \nmeasures are in place to enhance the integrity of the market and safeguard the interest of investors. \nThe criteria for shortlisting any security trading on the Stock Exchanges for ASM is based on objective \ncriteria, which includes market-based parameters such as high low price variation, concentration of \nclient accounts, close to close price variation, market capitalization, average daily trading volume \nand its change, and average delivery percentage, among others. Securities are subject to GSM when \nits price is not commensurate with the financial health and fundamentals of the issuer. Specific \nparameters for GSM include net worth, net fixed assets, price to earning ratio, market capitalization \nand price to book value, among others.  \n \nFactors within and beyond our control may lead to our securities being subject to GSM or ASM. In \nthe event our Equity Shares are subject to such surveillance measures implemented by the Stock \nExchange, we may be subject to certain additional restrictions in connection with trading of our \nEquity Shares such as limiting trading frequency (for example, trading either allowed once in a week \nor a month) or freezing of price on upper side of trading which may have an adverse effect on the \nmarket price of our Equity Shares or may in general cause disruptions in the development of an active \ntrading market for our Equity Shares. \n \n57. There is no guarantee that the Equity Shares issued pursuant to the Issue will be listed on the EMERGE Platform of NSE in a timely manner or at all. \n \nIn accordance with Indian law and practice, permission for listing and trading of the Equity Shares \nissued pursuant to the Issue will not be granted until after the Equity Shares have been issued and \nallotted. Approval for listing and trading will require all relevant documents authorizing the issuance \nof Equity Shares to be submitted. There could be a failure or delay in listing the Equity Shares on the \nEMERGE Platform of NSE. Any failure or delay in obtaining the approval would restrict your ability to \ndispose of your Equity Shares. Page 62 of 402 58. There are restrictions on daily / weekly / monthly movements in the price of the Equity Shares, which may adversely affect a shareholder’s ability to sell, or the price at which it can sell, Equity \nShares at a particular point in time.  \n \nOnce listed, we would be subject to circuit breakers imposed by designated stock exchanges in India, \nwhich does not allow transactions beyond specified increases or decreases in the price of the Equity \nShares. This circuit breaker operates independently of the index-based market-wide circuit breakers \ngenerally imposed by SEBI on Indian stock exchanges. The percentage limit on circuit breakers is set \nby the stock exchanges based on the historical volatility in the price and trading volume of the Equity \nShares. The stock exchanges do not inform us of the percentage limit of the circuit breaker in effect \nfrom time to time and may change it without our knowledge. This circuit breaker limits the upward \nand downward movements in the price of the Equity Shares. As a result of this circuit breaker, no \nassurance may be given regarding your ability to sell your Equity Shares or the price at which you \nmay be able to sell your Equity Shares at any particular time. \n \n59. The Equity Shares have never been publicly traded, and, after the Issue, the Equity Shares may experience price and volume fluctuations, and an active trading market for the Equity Shares may \nnot develop. Further, the price of the Equity Shares may be volatile, and you may be unable to resell \nthe Equity Shares at or above the Issue Price, or at all. \n \nPrior to the Issue, there has been no public market for the Equity Shares, and an active trading market \non the Stock Exchanges may not develop or be sustained after the Issue.

The Issue Price of the Equity Shares is proposed to be determined \nthrough a fixed price process in accordance with the SEBI ICDR Regulations and may not be indicative \nof the market price of the Equity Shares at the time of commencement of trading of the Equity Shares \nor at any time thereafter. The market price of the Equity Shares may be subject to significant \nfluctuations in response to, among other factors, variations in our operating results of our Company, \nmarket conditions specific to the industry we operate in, developments relating to India, volatility in \nsecurities markets in jurisdictions other than India, variations in the growth rate of financial \nindicators, variations in revenue or earnings estimates by research publications, and changes in \neconomic, legal and other regulatory factors. \n \n60. After this Issue, the price of the Equity Shares may be highly volatile, or an active trading market for the Equity Shares may not develop.  \n \nThe price of the Equity Shares on the Stock Exchanges may fluctuate as a result of the factors, \nincluding: • \nVolatility in the Indian and global capital market;  \n• \nCompany’s results of operations and financial performance; \n• \nPerformance of Company’s competitors;  \n• \nChanges in our estimates of performance or recommendations by financial analysts; \n• \nSignificant developments in India’s economic and fiscal policies; and  \n• \nSignificant developments in India’s environmental regulations.  \n \nCurrent valuations may not be sustainable in the future and may also not be reflective of future \nvaluations for our industry and our Company. There has been no public market for the Equity Shares \nand the prices of the Equity Shares may fluctuate after this Issue. There can be no assurance that an \nactive trading market for the Equity Shares will develop or be sustained after this Issue or that the \nprice at which the Equity Shares are initially traded will correspond to the price at which the Equity \nShares will trade in the market subsequent to this Issue. \n \n61. The Issue price of our Equity Shares may not be indicative of the market price of our Equity Shares after the Issue and the market price of our Equity Shares may decline below the Issue price and you \nmay not be able to sell your Equity Shares at or above the Issue Price.

The market price of our Equity Shares could be subject to significant fluctuations after the Issue \nand may decline below the Issue Price. We cannot assure you that you will be able to sell your Equity \nShares at or above the Issue Price. Among the factors that could affect our share price include without \nlimitation. The following:  \n \n• Half yearly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators, such as earnings per share, net income and revenues;  \n• Changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports by analysts; \n• Speculation in the press or investment community; \n• General market conditions; and \n• Domestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance. 62. You will not be able to sell immediately on Stock Exchange any of the Equity Shares you purchase in the Issue until the Issue receives appropriate trading permissions. \n \nThe Equity Shares will be listed on the Stock Exchange. Pursuant to Indian regulations, certain actions \nmust be completed before the Equity Shares can be listed and trading may commence. We cannot \nassure you that the Equity Shares will be credited to investor’s demat accounts, or that trading in the \nEquity Shares will commence, within the time periods specified in the Red Herring Prospectus. Any \nfailure or delay in obtaining the approval would restrict your ability to dispose of the Equity Shares. \nIn accordance with section 40 of the Companies Act, 2013, in the event that the permission of listing \nthe Equity Shares is denied by the stock exchanges, we are required to refund all monies collected to \ninvestors. \n \n63.

Our Company \nmay complete the allotment of Equity shares even if such events occur, and such events limit the \nBidders ability to sell the Equity Shares allotted pursuant to the Issue or cause the trading price of \nEquity Shares to decline on listing. \n \n64. Sale of Equity Shares by our Promoter or other significant shareholder(s) may adversely affect the trading price of the Equity Shares. \n \nAny instance of disinvestments of equity shares by our Promoter or by other significant \nshareholder(s) may significantly affect the trading price of our Equity Shares. Further, our market \nprice may also be adversely affected even if there is a perception or belief that such sales of Equity \nShares might occur. \n \nEXTERNAL RISKS FACTORS \n \nIndustry Related Risks \n \n65. Changes in government regulations or their implementation could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Page 64 of 402 Our business and industry are regulated by different laws, rules and regulations framed by the Central \nand State Government. These regulations can be amended/changed on a short notice at the \ndiscretion of the Government. If we fail to comply with all applicable regulations or if the regulations \ngoverning our business or their implementation change adversely, we may incur increased costs or \nbe subject to penalties, which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and \nresults of operations. \n \n66. A slowdown in economic growth in India could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. \n \nOur performance and growth are, and will be, dependent to a large extent on the health of the Indian \neconomy and consumption spending by households. Economic growth in India is affected by various \nfactors including domestic consumption and savings, rate of inflation in India, balance of trade \nmovements, and global economic uncertainty. Most of our assets and employees are located in India, \nand we intend to continue to develop and expand in India. \n \nInflation, measures to combat inflation and public speculation about possible governmental actions \nto combat inflation have also contributed significantly to economic uncertainty in India and \nheightened volatility in the Indian capital markets. Periods of higher inflation may also slow the \ngrowth rate of the Indian economy and increase some of our costs and expenses. To the extent that \nthe demand for our products decreases or costs and expenses increase, and we are not able to pass \nthose increases in costs and expenses on to our customers, our operating margins and operating \nincome may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, \nfinancial condition and results of operations. \n \nOther Risks \n \n67. Changing laws, rules and regulations and legal uncertainties, including adverse application of tax laws, may adversely affect our business and financial performance. \n \nThe regulatory and policy environment in India is evolving and subject to change. Such changes in \napplicable law and policy in India, including the instances described below, may adversely affect our \nbusiness, financial condition, results of operation, performance and prospects in India, to the extent \nthat we are not able to suitably respond to and comply with such changes. \n \nFor instance, in November 2016, the Government of India demonetized certain – high value \ndenominations of currency. Trading and retail businesses in India were impacted for a limited period \nof time on account of such demonetization. Such businesses have subsequently needed to introduce \nadditional point of sale instruments to improve their collection process. \n \nThe Government of India implemented a comprehensive national goods and service tax (“GST”) \nregime that combines taxes and levies by the central and state governments into a unified rate \nstructure from July 01, 2017, which we believe will result in fundamental changes. However, given \nits recent introduction, there is no established practice regarding the implementation of, and \ncompliance with, GST. The implementation of the new GST regime has increased the operational and \ncompliance burden for Indian companies and has also led to various uncertainties. Any future \nincreases and amendments to the GST regime may further affect the overall tax efficiency of \ncompanies operating in India and may result in significant additional taxes becoming payable. Our \nbusiness and financial performance could be adversely affected by any unexpected or onerous \nrequirements or regulations resulting from the introduction of GST or any changes in laws or \ninterpretation of existing laws, or the promulgation of new laws, rules and regulations relating to \nGST, as it is implemented. Further, as GST is implemented, there can be no assurance that we will \nnot be required to comply with additional procedures and/or obtain additional approvals and \nlicenses from the government and other regulatory bodies or that they will not impose onerous \nrequirements and conditions on our operations. Any such changes and the related uncertainties with Page 65 of 402 respect to the implementation of GST may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial \ncondition and results of operations. \n \nFurther, the General Anti Avoidance Rules came into effect on April 1, 2017. The effect of the \napplication of these provisions to our business in India is at present uncertain. Furthermore, the \nFinance Act, 2019 instituted a number of amendments to the existing direct and indirect tax regime \nwhich includes the withdrawal of long-term capital gains exemptions on equity shares, long term \ncapital gains applicability in the hands of Foreign Institutional Investors and applicability of dividend \ndistribution tax for certain transactions with shareholders, among others. \n \n68. Political instability or a change in economic liberalization and deregulation policies could seriously harm business and economic conditions in India generally and our business in particular. The Government of India has traditionally exercised and continues to exercise influence over many \naspects of the economy. Our business and the market price and liquidity of our Equity Shares may be \naffected by interest rates, changes in Government policy, taxation, social and civil unrest and other \npolitical, economic or other developments in or affecting India. The rate of economic liberalization \ncould change, and specific laws and policies affecting the information technology sector, foreign \ninvestment and other matters affecting investment in our securities could change as well. Any \nsignificant change in such liberalization and de-regulation policies could adversely affect business and \neconomic conditions in India, generally, and our business, prospects, financial condition and results \nof operations, in particular. \n \n69. We cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of facts and other statistics with respect to India, the Indian economy and industry in which our company operates contained in the Red \nHerring Prospectus.  \n \nWhile facts and other statistics in this Red Herring Prospectus relating to India, the Indian economy \nand the industry in which our company operates has been based on various government publications \nand reports from government agencies that we believe are reliable, we cannot guarantee the quality \nor reliability of such materials. While we have taken reasonable care in the reproduction of such \ninformation, industry facts and other statistics have not been prepared or independently verified by \nus or any of our respective affiliates or advisors and, therefore we make no representation as to their \naccuracy or completeness. These facts and other statistics include the facts and statistics included in \nthe chapter titled “Our Industry” beginning on page 133. Due to possibly flawed or ineffective data \ncollection methods or discrepancies between published information and market practice and other \nproblems, the statistics herein may be inaccurate or may not be comparable to statistics produced \nelsewhere and should not be unduly relied upon. Further, there is no assurance that they are stated \nor compiled on the same basis or with the same degree of accuracy, as the case may be, elsewhere. \n \n70. Financial instability in Indian financial markets could adversely affect our Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  \n \nIn this globalized world, the Indian economy and financial markets are significantly influenced by \nworldwide economic, financial and market conditions. Any financial turmoil, say in the United States \nof America, Europe, China or other emerging economies, may have a negative impact on the Indian \neconomy. Although economic conditions differ in each country, investors’ reactions to any significant \ndevelopments in one country can have adverse effects on the financial and market conditions in \nother countries. A loss in investor confidence in the financial systems, particularly in other emerging \nmarkets, may cause increased volatility in Indian financial markets. Indian financial markets have also \nexperienced the contagion effect of the global financial turmoil. Any prolonged financial crisis may \nhave an adverse impact on the Indian economy, thereby resulting in a material and adverse effect on \nour Company's business, operations, financial condition, profitability and price of its Shares. Stock \nexchanges in India have in the past experienced substantial fluctuations in the prices of listed \nsecurities. Page 66 of 402 71. Conditions in the Indian securities market may affect the price or liquidity of our Equity Shares. The Indian securities markets are smaller than securities markets in more developed economies and \nthe regulation and monitoring of Indian securities markets and the activities of investors, brokers and \nother participants differ, in some cases significantly, from those in the more developed economies. \nIndian stock exchanges have in the past experienced substantial fluctuations in the prices of listed \nsecurities. Further, the Indian stock exchanges have experienced volatility in the recent times. The \nIndian stock exchanges have also experienced problems that have affected the market price and \nliquidity of the securities of Indian companies, such as temporary exchange closures, broker defaults, \nsettlement delays and strikes by brokers. In addition, the governing bodies of the Indian stock \nexchanges have from time-to-time restricted securities from trading and limited price movements. A \nclosure of, or trading stoppage on the EMERGE Platform of National Stock Exchange of India Limited \ncould adversely affect the trading price of the Equity Shares. \n \n72. Global economic, political and social conditions may harm our ability to do business, increase our costs and negatively affect our stock price.  \n \nGlobal economic and political factors that are beyond our control, influence forecasts and directly \naffect performance. These factors include interest rates, rates of economic growth, fiscal and \nmonetary policies of governments, inflation, deflation, foreign exchange fluctuations, consumer \ncredit availability, fluctuations in commodities markets, consumer debt levels, unemployment trends \nand other matters that influence consumer confidence, spending and tourism. Increasing volatility in \nfinancial markets may cause these factors to change with a greater degree of frequency and \nmagnitude, which may negatively affect our stock prices.  \n \n73. Foreign investors are subject to foreign investment restrictions under Indian law that limits our ability to attract foreign investors, which may adversely impact the market price of the Equity \nShares. \n \nUnder the foreign exchange regulations currently in force in India, transfers of shares between non-\nresidents and residents are freely permitted (subject to certain exceptions) if they comply with the \npricing guidelines and reporting requirements specified by the RBI. If the transfer of shares, which \nare sought to be transferred, is not in compliance with such pricing guidelines or reporting \nrequirements or fall under any of the exceptions referred to above, then the prior approval of the \nRBI will be required. Additionally, shareholders who seek to convert the Rupee proceeds from a sale \nof shares in India into foreign currency and repatriate that foreign currency from India will require a \nno objection/ tax clearance certificate from the income tax authority. There can be no assurance that \nany approval required from the RBI or any other government agency can be obtained on any \nparticular terms or at all. \n \n74. The extent and reliability of Indian infrastructure could adversely affect our Company’s results of operations and financial condition. \nIndia’s physical infrastructure is in developing phase compared to that of many developed nations. \nAny congestion or disruption in its port, rail and road networks, electricity grid, communication \nsystems or any other public facility could disrupt our Company’s normal business activity. Any \ndeterioration of India’s physical infrastructure would harm the national economy; disrupt the \ntransportation of goods and supplies, and costs to doing business in India. These problems could \ninterrupt our Company’s business operations, which could have an adverse effect on its results of \noperations and financial condition. \n \n75. Any downgrading of India’s sovereign rating by an independent agency may harm our ability to raise financing. \n \nAny adverse revisions to India’s credit ratings for domestic and international debt by international \nrating agencies may adversely impact our ability to raise additional financing, and the interest rates Page 67 of 402 and other commercial terms at which such additional financing may be available. This could have an \nadverse effect on our business and future financial performance, our ability to obtain financing for \ncapital expenditures and the trading price of our Equity Shares. \n \n76. The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Hostilities, terrorist attacks, civil unrest and other acts of \nviolence could adversely affect the financial markets and our business.  \n \nThe occurrence of natural disasters, including cyclones, storms, floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, \ntornadoes, fires, explosions, pandemic disease and man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism \nand military actions, could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. \nTerrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may adversely affect the Indian securities markets. \nIn addition, any deterioration in international relations, especially between India and its neighboring \ncountries, may result in investor concern regarding regional stability which could adversely affect the \nprice of the Equity Shares. In addition, India has witnessed local civil disturbances in recent years, \nand it is possible that future civil unrest as well as other adverse social, economic or political events \nin India could have an adverse effect on our business. Such incidents could also create a greater \nperception that investment in Indian companies involves a higher degree of risk and could have an \nadverse effect on our business and the market price of the Equity Shares.

The reasons behind increase in working capital requirements \nof the company in previous two FYs and half year ended September 30, 2025 successively, are as \nunder: \n \nOur company is engaged in the manufacturing and processing of 164 types/varieties of spices which \ncan be broadly categorized as Ground Spices, Blend Spices and Whole Spices under the brand name \n“SHYAM”. In addition to our spice offerings, we are also engaged in trading and distribution of \nGrocery Products such as Black Salt, Rock Salt, Rice, Poha, Kasuri Methi (Dried Fenugreek) etc. and \na diverse range of Herbs and seasonings which includes Oregano, Peri Peri, Chilli Flakes, Mixed \nHerbs, Onion Flakes, Tomato Powder etc.  \n \nSummary of the production capacity of our Company and actual production for the last three FYs \nand period ended on September 30, 2025 is as under: Financial Years \n2025 \n2024 \n2023 \nInstalled \nCapacity For the period ended on September 30, 2025 Item Name Actual \nProduction % Increase Installed \nCapacity Actual \nProduction % Increase Installed \nCapacity Actual \nProduction % increase Installed \nCapacity Actual \nProduction in \nproduction in \nproduction in \nproduction (In Mts) \nGround \nSpices \n8760 \n1642.26 \n- \n8760 \n4531.17 \n80.71% \n3675 \n2507.38 \n12.99% \n3360 \n2218.97 (In MTs) (In Mts) (In MTs) (In Mts) (In MTs) (In Mts) (In MTs) Blended Spices \n3120 \n213.61 \n- \n3120 \n478.12 \n00.00 \n480 \n478.28 \n645.10% \n480 \n64.19 \nWhole Spices \n6180 \n472.75 \n- \n6180 \n729.33 \n(13.52%) \n1380 \n843.34 \n327.61% \n1380 \n197.22 \n \nIncrease of working capital gap in FY 2024 \nIn the FY 24, our company has ramped up the production of our offerings significantly due to fresh \nsanction of working capital limits from ₹ 700 lakhs to ₹ 1740 lakhs. With the increase in production, \nthere were more holdings of raw materials for continuous production requirements and storage of \nfinished goods, the levels of investment in raw materials and finished goods in FY 23 amounting to \n₹ 1,121.90 lakhs has increased to ₹ 2,321.09 lakhs in FY 24 leading to increase in investment in \ninventories by ₹ 1,859.90 lakhs.  \n \nFurther with the increase in production, we were able to increase our sales. The sales of our \ncompany in FY 24 were ₹ 10,760.52 lakhs in comparison to sales in FY 23 at ₹ 6,795.29 lakhs. The \nsales of our Company increased by ₹ 3,965.23 lakhs leading to 58.35% increase. The increase in \nsales has led to increase in levels of investment in trade receivables. The trade receivables \nincreased to ₹ 558.69 lakhs from ₹ 374.32 lakhs leading to increase in investment in trade \nreceivables by ₹ 184.37 lakhs. \n \nDue to increase in inventories and trade receivables in FY24, this resulted in negative cash flow \nfrom operations in FY24 which was funded by short term borrowings resulting in increase in level \nof debts of the company in FY24. These were the major reasons for increase in working capital \nrequirements of our company in FY 24 as compared with FY 23. Page 104 of 402 Increase of working capital gap in FY 2025 \nIn the FY 25, Our company anticipated the demand of ground spices and ramped up the production \nof ground spices majorly chili and store bulk qty of finished goods. The production of ground spices \nincreased by 80.71% in FY25 in comparison with FY24 which led to increase in levels of investment \nin raw materials, work-in-progress and finished goods while maintaining the production of blended \nspices and slightly declining the production of whole spices as per demand and supply mechanism \nprevalent in the markets. To meet the enhanced fund requirements, our Company increased \nworking capital limits from banks from ₹ 1,740 lakhs in FY24 to ₹ 3,530 lakhs in FY25. \n \nThe inventories of our company comprising of raw materials, work-in-progress and finished goods \nstood at ₹ 4,071.69 lakhs in FY 25 as compared to ₹ 2,981.80 lakhs.  \n \nFurther the sales of our Company in FY25 increase to ₹ 12,468.04 lakhs from ₹ 10,760.52 lakhs in \nFY24 leading to rise by 13.70%. The increase in sales has led to increase in levels of investment in \ntrade receivables of our company. The trade receivables increased to ₹ 859.02 lakhs from ₹ 558.69 \nlakhs leading to increase in investment in trade receivables by ₹ 300.33 lakhs. \n \nDue to increase in inventories and trade receivables in FY25, this resulted in negative cash flow \nfrom operations in FY25 which was funded by short term borrowings resulting in increase in level \nof debts of the company in FY25. These were the major reasons for increase in working capital \nrequirements of our company in FY 25 as compared with FY 24. \n \nIncrease of working capital gap during the period ended September 30, 2025 \nDuring the period ended September 30, 2025, the contribution of modern trade, comprising sales \nto large retail chains such as D-Mart, Metro Cash & Carry, Reliance Retail and Dealshare, has \nincreased significantly. The share of modern trade in our total revenue has risen from 0.43% in FY23 \nto 31.06% in FY24, 44.31% in FY25 and further to 48.66% during the period ended September 30, \n2025. Under the modern trade model, prompt delivery of goods is required upon receipt of orders \nfrom retail chains, necessitating higher levels of finished goods inventory. To support this \nrequirement and ensure uninterrupted production, our Company is also required to maintain \nadequate raw material inventory. As a result of these operational needs, total inventory comprising \nraw materials, work-in-progress and finished goods increased from ₹ 4,071.69 lakhs as at March \n31, 2025, to ₹ 4,515.09 lakhs as at September 30, 2025. For further details on revenue generated \nunder various business models, please refer to “Our Business – Revenue Model” on page 157-158. \n \nIn addition, our company booked revenue of ₹ 6,377.96 lakhs during the period ended September \n30, 2025, reflecting an annualized growth of 2.31% over FY25. The increase in sales correspondingly \nresulted in higher investment in trade receivables. Trade receivables increased from ₹ 859.02 lakhs \nas of March 31, 2025, to ₹ 1,028.08 lakhs as of September 30, 2025, representing an incremental \ninvestment of ₹ 169.06 lakhs. \n \nThe increase in raw material inventory, finished goods inventory and trade receivables during the \nperiod ended September 30, 2025, resulted in higher working capital being blocked in current \nassets. Although the Company generated positive cash flows from operating activities, the internal \naccruals were not sufficient to fully meet the expanded working capital requirements arising from \nthe growth in scale of operations and higher inventory holding levels. Accordingly, our Company \navailed short-term borrowings to bridge this gap, leading to an increase in the outstanding level of \nshort-term debt as at September 30, 2025. These factors were the primary contributors to the \nincrease in our working capital requirements during the period ending September 30, 2025, as \ncompared to FY25. \n \nBasis of estimation of working capital requirement \nOn the basis of existing and estimated working capital requirement of our Company and \nassumptions for such working capital requirements, our Board, pursuant to its resolution dated \nNovember 26, 2025, has approved the projected working capital requirements for FY26, FY27 and Page 105 of 402 FY28 and the proposed funding of such working capital requirements as set forth below: (Amount in Lakhs) \nS. \nNo. \nParticulars \nMarch 31, 2026 March 31, 2027 March 31, 2028 (Projected) \nA. \nCurrent Assets  \n \n \n1. \nInventory \n \n \n \n \n− \nRaw Materials \n 2,529.86  \n 4,413.70  \n 4,962.33  \n \n− \nFinished Goods \n1,701.63 \n2,585.76  \n3,010.02  \n \n− \nWork In Progress \n287.56 \n 487.21  \n551.85  \n2. \nTrade Receivables  \n1,241.10 \n1,882.19 \n2,186.30  \n3. \nAdvance to suppliers \n 350.00  \n 50.00  \n 50.00  \n4. \nOther Financial and Current Assets  \n 323.84  \n 75.84  \n 58.00  \n \nTotal Current Assets  \n 6,443.99  \n 9,494.70  \n 10,818.50 \n \n  \n \n \n \nB. \nCurrent Liabilities  \n \n \n \n1. \nTrade payables  \n 156.64  \n 271.01  \n 283.20  \n2. \nAdvance from Customers \n 3.00  \n 3.50  \n 4.00  \n3. \nOther Financial and Current Liabilities  \n 187.67  \n 247.30  \n 240.55  \n \nTotal Current Liabilities  \n 347.31  \n 521.81  \n 527.75  \n \n  \n \n \n \nC. \nWorking Capital Requirements \n 6,093.69  \n 8,976.73  \n 10,318.62  \n \n  \n \n \n \nE. \nFunding Pattern \n \n \n \n1. \nExternal Borrowings (Projected) (Projected) − Working Capital Limits from Banks and financial Institutions \n2,500.00  \n2,500.00  \n2,500.00  \n2. \nNetworth \n 3,010.68 \n5,722.89 \n7,790.75 \n3. \nIPO Proceeds \n 576.00  \n 750.00  \n- \n \nTotal \n6,086.68 \n8,972.89 \n10,290.75 Justification of enhanced working capital requirements \nOur company operates under a multi-channel revenue model, which includes General Trade, \nModern Trade, HORECA sales, Private Labelling, Quick Commerce, Exports, and Website sales. \nHistorically our focus has been on general trade which accounted for more than 90% of our total \nrevenue up to FY23. From FY24, our company changed its business strategy and started focusing \nmore on revenue models having high volume trades. The volume in modern trade business \nsegment is much higher in comparison to the one in general trade business segment. Our sales \nunder the modern trade segment increased from ₹ 29.25 Lakhs in FY23 to ₹ 5,524.92 Lakhs in FY25 \nand we have booked sales of ₹ 3,103.58 lakhs in this segment during the period ended September \n30, 2025, registering annualized growth of 12.35% over FY25. Simultaneously, the total volumes of \nthe goods sold of our company also increased from 3,401.81 MT in FY23 to 5,133.99 MT in FY25. \nFurther, volume of total goods sold during the period ended September 30, 2025 is 2,695.59 MT \nindicating annualized growth of 5.03% over FY25.  \n \nOur company intends to focus more over its higher volume modern trade segment and plans to \nexpand and cover all the modern trade players in the industry such as DMart, Reliance Retail, \nDealshare and Metro Cash and Carry etc on pan India basis. This will help us to boost the revenue \nof our company.  \n \nFurther, with the increase in the revenue generated from modern trade segment, the sale of our \nblended spices also increased from ₹ 1,046.61 Lakhs in FY23 to ₹ 2,099.40 Lakhs in FY25 \nsimultaneously as this product category remains to be in high demand in these supermarket \noutlets. \n \nTo fulfill the demand of our product offerings generated from modern trade business segment, our \ncompany needs to maintain optimum level of inventory of raw material and finished goods, \ntherefore working capital gap is increasing in FY26, FY27 and FY28.  \n \nSimilarly, our company is also focusing on expanding its presence on quick commerce platforms \nand have done tie-ups with all the major quick commerce players such as Swiggy Instamart, Zepto, Page 106 of 402 Flipkart minutes and Blinkit. This enables us to reach tech-savvy urban consumers who prioritize \nspeed and convenience, further expanding our brand presence in the fast-growing digital retail \nspace. \n \nAdditionally, our company is further enhancing its production capacity to cater to demand of our \nproducts under private labelling segment. Historically we have been doing private labelling but its \ncontribution to our revenue from operations has been very limited. Going forward with the \nenhanced capacity, our company will be focusing more upon undertaking more private labelling \nassignments.    \n \nFurther, we also want to establish our brand “SHYAM” in the market and will be undertaking \nadvertisement and marketing campaigns including hiring of Mrs. Preity Zinta as a brand \nambassador of our company. Investment in advertisement and marketing expenses will help our \ncompany to increase its visibility and establish our brand image in the market. This in turn will help \nus in increasing demand of our products, ultimately generating more revenue for our company. \n \nAdditionally, our company also intends to tap into new markets and increase our presence in \ninternational markets. In FY25, our export sales increased from ₹ 85.16 Lakhs in FY24 to ₹ 169.53 \nLakhs in FY25. We have booked export sales of ₹ 143.13 lakhs during the period ended September \n30, 2025. We exported our products to countries like UAE, Mongolia, Nepal and Saudi Arabia. The \ndetails of the export sales made by our company during FY24, FY25 and period ended September \n30, 2025 is as under: (Amount in Lakhs) Countries \nSeptember % of Total Revenue \nFY25 \n% of Total Revenue \nFY24 \n% of Total Revenue \nUAE \n143.13 \n2.24% \n127.14 \n1.02% \n7.30 \n0.07% \nNepal \n- \n- \n17.26 \n0.14% \n6.82 \n0.06% \nMongolia \n- \n- \n25.13 \n0.20% \n32.77 \n0.30% \nOman \n- \n- \n- \n- \n38.27 \n0.36% \nSaudi Arabia \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \nTotal \n143.13 \n2.24% \n169.53 \n1.36% \n85.16 \n0.79% 30, 2025 In continuation to that, our company aims to export its products to United States of America (USA). \nIn order to export our products to USA, our company has obtained registration with U.S Food and \nDrug Administration (FDA), vide its registration number 15206203708, which enables us to gain \naccess to USA market and sell our products there.  \n \nTherefore, to continue the expansion of our international business and tap into new markets, our \ncompany needs to maintain optimum level of inventory of raw materials and finished goods to \navoid any delays and ensure smooth operations. \n \nAssumptions of Working Capital Requirement \nHolding levels and justifications for holding period levels on the basis of Audited standalone \nFinancial Statements: (Approximate holding Period in days*) September FY 27-28 \n(Projected) Particulars \nFY 22-23  \n(Audited) FY 23-24  \n(Audited) FY 24-25  \n(Audited) FY 25-26 \n(Projected) FY 26-27 \n(Projected) 30, 2025 \n(Audited) Current Assets: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInventories: - \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n− Raw Material \n53 \n96  \n45  \n54 \n90  \n91  \n91  \n− Work in Progress \n- \n- \n9 \n10 \n9 \n9 \n9 \n− Finished goods \n 26  \n 26  \n 90  \n105 \n 52  \n 52  \n 52  \nTrade Receivables \n 20  \n 19  \n 25  \n29 \n 30  \n 30  \n 30  \nCurrent Liabilities: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTrade payables \n 22  \n 36  \n 22  \n32 \n 5  \n 5  \n 5  \nNet working Capital Cycle  \n78.00  \n105.00  \n147.00  \n166.00 \n176.00  \n177.00  \n177.00  \n*30 days in a month Page 107 of 402 Justifications for Holding Period levels: \nJustifications for the holding levels mentioned in the table above are provided below: Particulars \nJustification for Holding Levels Our company is engaged in the manufacturing and processing of 164 types/varieties of spices \nwhich can be broadly categorized as Ground Spices, Blend Spices and Whole Spices under the \nbrand name “SHYAM”. In addition to our spice offerings, we are also engaged in trading and \ndistribution of Grocery Products such as Black Salt, Rock Salt, Rice, Poha, Kasuri Methi (Dried \nFenugreek) etc. and a diverse range of Herbs and seasonings which includes Oregano, Peri \nPeri, Chilli Flakes, Mixed Herbs, Onion Flakes, Tomato Powder etc.  \n \nIn the FY23, FY24, FY25 and period ended September 30, 2025, our Company maintained raw \nmaterial inventory levels for 53 days, 96 days, 45 days and 54 days respectively. During the \nstart of Q4 of FY25, our company converted the raw material in hand into finished goods to \nensure an uninterrupted supply of finished goods in Q4 of FY25 and Q1 of FY26. This led to a \ndecrease in closing inventory of raw materials leading to a decline in the holding levels of raw \nmaterial and it fell below the average holding period to 45 days. On the same hand, the closing \ninventory of finished goods increased, leading to an increase in average holding levels of \nfinished goods. \n \nFurther, share of revenue from the modern trade segment in total revenue from operations \nincreased from 44.31% in FY25 to 48.66% during the half year ended September 30, 2025. \nThis segment requires prompt delivery of goods, necessitating the maintenance of higher \nlevels of finished goods inventory, as well as higher raw material inventory to support \nuninterrupted production and timely order fulfilment. It has resulted in an increase in average \nholding levels of raw material inventory to 54 days during H2 of FY26.   \n \nOur company has estimated inventory holdings of raw materials to 90 days in FY26 and 91 \ndays each for FY27, and FY 28 due to the following reasons: \n(i) Our raw material availability is seasonal and our major purchases is done at the time of Raw Material crop harvesting season to procure best quality raw material at competitive prices, \ntherefore, we procure in bulk. \n(ii) We source from various states across India like Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan etc therefore to save the transportation cost we used to maintain minimum inventory of three \nmonths in past. \n(iii) With expansion in our production capacity, we need to maintain larger stocks of raw material to ensure continuous production of finished goods so that optimum utilization of \nproduction capacity can be achieved without hampering operations. \n(iv) Further, we have also expanded our product line and presently manufacturing/ processing 164 types/ varieties of spices. This expanded range of products along with changing \nrecipes requires to hold a larger variety of raw materials for a longer time, waiting for a \nright time to process them.   \n \nTherefore, our company has estimated inventory holdings of raw materials based on past \ntrends and estimated holding levels to 90 days in FY26 and 91 days each for FY27, and FY 28. In the FY23 and FY24, our Company was maintaining Work in Progress in the raw materials \ninventory only. In FY25, our company started maintaining raw materials and work in progress \nstock separately and has estimated work in progress holding of the company for the FY 26, \nFY27 and FY28 at the level of 9 days level per production process of our company. Work in Progress In the FY23, FY24, FY25 and stub period September 30, 2025, our Company maintained \nfinished goods inventory levels for 26 days, 26 days, 90 days and 105 days respectively. During \nthe start of Q4 of FY25, our company converted the raw material in hand into finished goods \nto ensure an uninterrupted supply of finished goods in Q4 of FY25 and Q1 of FY26. This led to \nan increase in closing inventory of finished goods and ultimately leading to an increase in the \nholding levels of finished goods to 92 days. On the same hand, the closing inventory of raw \nmaterials decreased leading to a decrease in average holding levels of raw materials. \n \nFurther, share of revenue from the modern trade segment in total revenue from operations \nincreased from 44.31% in FY25 to 48.66% during the half year ended September 30, 2025. \nThis segment requires prompt delivery of goods, necessitating the maintenance of higher \nlevels of finished goods inventory, resulting in increase in average holding level of finished \ngoods inventory to 105 days during H2 of FY26. \n \nWith the change in the business strategy of our company, we are planning to focus more upon \nthe modern trade and quick commerce business segments. In modern trade, we are supplying Finished Goods Page 108 of 402 Particulars \nJustification for Holding Levels \nto retail chains like DMart, Reliance Retail, Metro Cash and Carry, and DealShare. To ensure \nuninterrupted supply to these retail chains, we need to hold large inventory of finished goods. \nIn addition to this, quick commerce also requires ready availability of finished goods for \nprompt delivery of goods to end customers. These segments provide higher volume trade to \nour company and thus to fulfill the demand of the customers in these business segments, we \nestimate to increase the holding period of our finished goods inventory to 52 days in FY26, \nFY27 and FY28. Our company generally provides products on credit to our customers for a credit period of 20 \ndays, 19 days, 25 days and 29 days in the FY23, FY24, FY25 and period ended September 30, \n2025, respectively, which is as per the acceptable business practice in the similar trade. \nOur company has estimated holding levels of 30 days each for FY26, FY27, and FY28 \nrespectively based on the holding levels for FY25. Our management believes that by providing \nadditional credit period to our customers will help us to increase the volumes of trade and \nsecuring bulk orders for our company. Trade \nReceivables Our company’s trade payables predominantly comprise of payables towards the purchase of \nraw materials. The trade payable days were approximately 22 days, 36 days, 22 days and 32 \ndays of purchases for FY23, FY24, FY25 and half year ended September 30, 2025, respectively.  \nOur Company has proposed to utilize a part of the fresh issue proceeds towards working \ncapital requirements which will lead to payment to creditors and reduction in the outstanding \ndays payable. Hence trade payables days are estimated at 5 days of purchases each for FY26, \nFY27, and FY28 respectively which will enable our Company to get better terms from our \nvendors. This would help us to avail good cash discounts and negotiate with our vendors on \nbetter price to our advantage. \n \n2. Repayment/Pre-payment, in full or in part, of certain outstanding borrowings availed by our Trade Payables company   \nWe have availed a majority of our fund‐based and non‐fund‐based facilities in the ordinary course \nof business from various scheduled commercial banks, financial institutions and other entities. The \nborrowing arrangements entered into by us include, inter alia, term loans and working capital loans. \nFor further information on the financial indebtedness of our Company, see the chapter titled \n“Financial Indebtedness” beginning on page 290. As of November 30, 2025, our Company had an \noutstanding total secured borrowing of ₹ 4,377.16 Lakhs. We propose to utilise a portion of the Net \nProceeds aggregating to ₹ 1,000.00 lakhs for Repayment/Pre-payment, in full or in part, of cash \ncredit borrowing facility availed by our company from scheduled commercial banks.  \n \nPursuant to the terms of the borrowing arrangements, prepayment of certain indebtedness may \nattract prepayment charges as prescribed by the respective lender. Such prepayment charges, as \napplicable, will also be funded out of the Net Proceeds. Given the nature of the borrowings and the \nterms of repayment or prepayment, the aggregate outstanding amounts under the borrowings may \nvary from time to time and we may, in accordance with the relevant repayment schedule, repay or \nrefinance some of the existing borrowings prior to Allotment or avail of additional credit facilities. \n  \nFurther, the outstanding amounts under these borrowings as well as the sanctioned limits are \ndependent on several factors and may vary with our business cycle with multiple intermediate \nrepayments, drawdowns and enhancement of sanctioned limits. Accordingly, our Company may \nutilise the Net Proceeds for repayment/prepayment of any such refinanced facilities (including any \nprepayment fees or penalties thereon) or any additional facilities obtained by our Company. \nHowever, the aggregate amount to be utilised from the Net Proceeds towards prepayment, \nrepayment or redemption of borrowings (including refinanced or additional facilities availed, if any), \nin part or full, will not exceed ₹ 1,000.00 lakhs. In light of the above, at the time of filing of Red \nHerring Prospectus, the table below shall be suitably updated to reflect the revised amounts or \nloans, as the case may be. Such repayment or prepayment will help reduce our outstanding \nindebtedness and debt servicing costs and enable utilization of the internal accruals for further \ninvestment towards business growth and expansion. In addition, repayment/prepayment of the \nloans will add to the profitability of our Company due to reduced finance cost and also the \nimprovement in the debt‐to‐equity ratio of our Company which enable us to raise further resources Page 109 of 402 in the future to fund potential business development opportunities and plans to grow and expand \nour business in the future. \n \nDebt-Equity Ratio of our company and our listed peers for the stub period September 30, 2025 and \nin FY 25, FY 24 and FY 23 is depicted in the table below: Name Of Company \nDebt-Equity Ratio \nSeptember 30, 2025 \n2024-2025 \n2023-2024 \n2022-2023 \nShyam Dhani Industries Limited   \n1.73 \n2.00 \n1.57 \n1.38 \nOur company Listed Peers  \n \n \n \n \nMadhusudan Masala Limited   \n0.69 \n0.71 \n1.13 \n3.98 \nNHC Foods Limited \n0.53 \n0.38 \n1.21 \n1.01 \nM/s G.L.

Despite \nelevated financing costs and heightened geopolitical tensions, global activity firmed in early 2024. \nGlobal growth is envisaged to reach a slightly faster pace this year than previously expected, due \nmainly to the continued solid expansion of the U.S. economy. However, the extent of expected \ndeclines in global interest rates has moderated amid lingering inflation pressures in key economies. By \nhistorical standards, the global outlook remains subdued: both advanced economies and emerging \nmarket and developing economies (EMDEs) are set to grow at a slower pace over 2024-26 than in the decade preceding the pandemic.  \n \nDomestic demand is projected to improve in many EMDEs \nthis year, in line with a moderate cyclical recovery from the \neffects of high inflation, tight financial conditions, and anemic \nindustrial activity. Aggregate EMDE growth is nonetheless \npoised to decelerate slightly mainly because of idiosyncratic \nfactors in some large economies. Moreover, significant \nchallenges persist in vulnerable economies—including in low-\nincome countries (LICs) and those facing elevated levels of \nconflict and violence—where growth prospects have \ndeteriorated markedly since January.   \n \nGlobal trade growth is recovering, supported by a pickup in goods trade. Services-trade growth is \nexpected to provide less of a tailwind this year, given that tourism has nearly recovered to pre \npandemic levels. However, the trade outlook remains lackluster compared to recent decades, partly \nreflecting a proliferation of trade-restrictive measures and elevated trade policy uncertainty.   \n \nAggregate commodity prices have increased since late last year. Amid fluctuations, average oil prices \nare expected to be slightly higher in 2024 than in 2023, underpinned by a tight demand-supply balance \nin a context of continued geopolitical tensions. Nonetheless, average energy prices are projected to \nbe marginally lower this year than last—reflecting notable declines in prices for natural gas and coal—\nwhile remaining well above pre-pandemic levels. Metals prices are expected to be little changed over \nthe forecast horizon, as demand related to metals-intensive clean energy investments and a broader \npickup in global industrial activity attenuate the impact on commodity demand of declining real estate \nactivity in China. Well-supplied markets for grains and other agricultural commodities should see \nedible food crop prices decline modestly. Page 133 of 402 Inflation continues to wane globally, making progress toward central bank \ntargets in advanced economies and EMDEs, but at a slower pace than \npreviously expected. Core inflation has remained stubbornly high in many \neconomies, supported by rapid growth of services prices. Over the remainder \nof 2024, continued tight monetary policy stances and slowing wage increases \nshould help reduce inflation further. By the end of 2026, global inflation is \nexpected to settle at an average rate of 2.8 percent, broadly consistent with \ncentral bank targets.  \n \nThe anticipated extent of monetary easing in advanced economies this \nyear has diminished substantially since late 2023—by more than a \npercentage point in the case of the United States. Expected policy rate \npaths diverge across major economies, as the European Central Bank \nproceeds with policy easing while the U.S. Federal Reserve keeps rates on \nhold for longer. Indeed, aside from short-term fluctuations, market \nexpectations for the path of U.S. interest rates have repeatedly moved \nhigher since 2022. Despite this market reassessment, global financial \nconditions have eased this year, reflecting solid risk appetite following last \nyear’s progress on disinflation and diminished concerns about the \npossibility of a sharp slowdown in global growth. In particular, global equity markets have made sizable \ngains.  \n \nEMDE \nfinancial \nconditions \nsimilarly \nbecame \nmore \naccommodative early this year, aided by declining domestic \npolicy rates, improving global sentiment, and expected \neasing of advancedeconomy monetary conditions. EMDE \nconditions turned somewhat less accommodative in the \nsecond quarter, as a strengthening of the U.S. dollar—\nprompted by geopolitical tensions and firm inflation data in \nthe United States— coincided with a bout of capital outflows. \nAlthough market perceptions of sovereign credit risk have \ngenerally eased this year, EMDE borrowing costs continue to \nbe high, and marked divergences persist. Indeed, credit ratings and debt sustainability analyses \nindicate that about 40 percent of EMDEs remain acutely vulnerable to debt-related stress. Across the forecast horizon, global growth remains lackluster by recent historical standards, at about \n0.4 percentage point below the 2010-19 average. In 2024-25, growth is set to underperform its \naverage pace in the 2010s in nearly 60 percent of economies, representing more than 80 percent of \nglobal output and population. The subdued outlook—despite the anticipated moderation of various \ncyclical headwinds— underscores a secular deceleration of potential growth in many large economies. \nRelative to pre pandemic norms, growth has weakened notably in countries that experienced high \nrates of inflation, much of which emanated from shocks to supply chains and commodity prices. Yet \nthis trend is set to continue in the coming years, suggesting potentially enduring supply-side weakness.   \nGDP per capita in EMDEs is forecast to grow at about 3 percent on average over 2024-26, well below Deviation of output from pre-pandemic trends Page 134 of 402 the average in 2010-19. Excluding China, EMDE per capita GDP growth is forecast to be lower still, \naveraging 2.5 percent over 2024-26. Some large EMDEs, such as India, are expected to see continued \nsolid per capita growth. Yet the trend of the 2020s so far is one of uneven and limited progress. Nearly \nhalf of EMDEs are set to lose ground relative to advanced economies when viewed over the 2020-24 \nperiod. Although this trend is expected to improve somewhat over 2025-26 in EMDEs as a whole, per \ncapita growth is set to remain stagnant in many LICs and FCS. \n \n(Source: https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/global-economic-prospects) \n \nGLOBAL RISK AND POLICY CHALLENGES \nRisks to the outlook have become somewhat more balanced since January, with the global economy \nthus far proving resilient to high financing costs. However, the balance of risks remains tilted to the \ndownside amid elevated uncertainty. Heightened geopolitical tensions could sharply depress \nsentiment, disrupt trade and commodity markets, push up inflation, and hurt economic activity; in \nparticular, a conflict-related disruption to global oil supply could push oil prices markedly higher and \nundermine the disinflation process. Elevated trade policy uncertainty—already at an unusually high \nlevel relative to previous years with major elections since 2000—and proliferating trade restrictions \ncould weigh on trade prospects and economic activity. Further trade fragmentation could have \nadverse global repercussions via declining economic confidence, increasing trade distortions, and \nrelated financial market reactions. Advanced-economy interest rates are at levels last seen before the 2008-09 global financial crisis, and, \nin light of persistently above-target inflation and tight labor markets, they are likely to remain high for \nsome time. Over the next couple of years, policy interest rates in advanced economies are expected \nto be more than double their 2000-19 average. Although the global economy has withstood high \ninterest rates better than was anticipated, interest rate-sensitive components of activity will continue \nto be restrained. Moreover, if further delays in the disinflation process emerge, policy rate cuts may \nbe postponed. A higher resulting path for interest rates, relative to the baseline, could give rise to \nmarkedly tighter financial conditions and significantly weaker global growth. Page 135 of 402 Policy makers face a range of daunting challenges. Coordinated \nimprovements in debt relief will be necessary to free up resources for \ngrowthenhancing investments, particularly in some of the most \nvulnerable EMDEs, given elevated financing needs. Enhanced \ninternational cooperation is needed to tackle the threat of climate \nchange, the fragmentation of trade networks, and mounting food \ninsecurity and conflict. Global cooperation is also essential to leverage \nthe benefits of new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), \nincluding by tapping AI solutions to address global challenges. Fiscal space remains narrow in many EMDEs amid weak revenues \nand elevated debt-servicing costs. Decisive measures will be \nneeded to boost fiscal resources for public investment. These \ncould include reforms to mobilize domestic revenues, the \nharnessing of digital technologies to simplify tax payments and \nrecords management, and reform of costly and inefficient \nsubsidies. Furthermore, even with increased public resources, \nimproved spending efficiency will be needed to meet a wide range \nof development challenges. In particular, it is critical to improve \ninfrastructure investment efficiency, where EMDEs significantly lag \nadvanced economies.  \n \nIn the case of small states, elevated exposure to external shocks poses a formidable fiscal challenge, \nunderscoring the need to balance additional investments in human capital and climate-resilient \ninfrastructure with the maintenance of adequate fiscal buffers.   \n \n(Source: https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/global-economic-prospects) \n \nGLOBAL TRADE \nGlobal trade in goods and services was nearly flat in 2023—the \nweakest performance outside of global recessions in the past 50 years. \nAmid a sharp slowdown in global industrial production, the volume of \ngoods trade contracted for most of 2023 and fell by 1.9 percent for the \nyear as a whole. The evolution of goods trade diverged across regions, \nwith volumes declining in advanced economies, especially in Europe, \nand stagnating in EMDEs as expansions in China and Europe and \nCentral Asia (ECA) offset contractions in Latin America and the \nCaribbean (LAC), Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and Middle East and North \nAfrica (MNA).   \n \nThe value of global services trade grew about 9 percent in 2023, \ndriven primarily by a recovery in tourism flows—exports of travel \nservices surged by about 38 percent (WTO 2024). However, the pace \nof expansion in tourism was substantially below that in 2022, with \nrecent data indicating tourism activity in line with pre-pandemic \nlevels, suggesting a near-full recovery in most regions. Stabilization \nin services trade is reflected in the steadying of the global services \nPMI for new export orders, which has remained closer to neutral \nthresholds compared to last year. Page 136 of 402 Global trade growth is projected to pick up to 2.5 percent this year, \na significant improvement from last year but well below the average \nrates observed in the two decades preceding the pandemic (figure \n1.3.C). The forecast entails a pickup in goods trade growth after a \nsluggish start to the year, supported by a rebound in global goods \ndemand as inventory restocking resumes in the United States and \nthe euro area, and as demand from China stabilizes. Meanwhile, \nservices trade growth is expected to stabilize near its pre-pandemic \npace. In 2025, trade growth is expected to firm to 3.4 percent, in \ntandem with a pickup in growth in the euro area and EMDEs \nexcluding China, and remain steady in 2026. \n \nDespite the expected growth in trade this year, by the end of 2024 \nglobal trade is set to register the slowest half-decade of growth \nsince the 1990s, mirroring subdued global GDP growth (figure \n1.3.D). In the near term, the responsiveness of global trade to global \noutput is likely to remain lower than before the pandemic, reflecting \nmuted investment growth and the recent proliferation of trade \nrestrictions worldwide.   \n \n(Source: https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/global-economic-prospects) GLOBAL INFLATION \nGlobal inflation has continued to decline, yet it remains above target in \nmost advanced economies and in about one-fourth of inflation-\ntargeting EMDEs. The initial phase of disinflation after the pandemic \nwas underpinned by falling energy prices as well as waning supply chain \npressures. Recently, the pace of consumer price disinflation has \nslowed, reflecting a partial rebound in energy prices, along with a \nnotable slowdown in the rate of decline in core inflation. In advanced economies, disinflation in consumer goods prices \nappears to have bottomed out, while inflation in consumer services \nremains elevated. In the United States, resilient economic activity, \nalongside rapid increases in the cost of shelter, has given rise to \npersistently high services and, more broadly, core inflation over the \npast few months. To some extent, the strength of U.S. productivity \ngrowth has mitigated these trends, likely lessening the inflationary \neffects of rising wages. In contrast, subdued productivity in the euro \narea has driven economy-wide labor costs higher, underpinning \nelevated core and services inflation, despite anemic euro area \ndemand.  \n \nIn EMDEs, headline inflation has generally continued to recede on a \n12-month basis. Across most EMDEs in East Asia and Pacific (EAP) and \nLAC, headline inflation broadly continued to trend near or below pre-\npandemic averages through late 2023 and early 2024, despite \nreaccelerating in some countries. However, progress has been slow \nand uneven in other regions, with elevated core price increases \ncontributing to high headline inflation rates. As in advanced \neconomies, persistently high core inflation in EMDEs has been driven \nby services prices, including for shelter. Page 137 of 402 Greater-than-anticipated inflationary pressures earlier this year \nhave led to an upward revision to the projection for near-term \nglobal inflation. Nevertheless, aside from a small group of countries \nwhere very high inflation reflects idiosyncratic domestic challenges, \nglobal inflation is expected to decline to 3.5 percent in 2024, before \neasing further, to 2.9 percent in 2025 and 2.8 percent in 2026, \nbroadly consistent with average country inflation targets. The \nslowdown is expected to be driven by softening core inflation, as \nservices demand moderates and wage growth slows, in addition to \na modest decline in commodity prices. Surveys of inflation \nexpectations similarly imply gradual global disinflation over the next \ntwo years. (Source: https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/global-economic-prospects) \n \nFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS \nGlobal financial conditions have eased, on balance, since last year, primarily reflecting declines in risk \npremia amid still-elevated interest rates. Central banks across major advanced economies are \nexpected to gradually lower policy rates this year, but the level of real interest rates is set to remain a \nheadwind to economic activity— albeit a diminishing one—for some time. Policy rate projections \nderived from financial markets have been volatile since U.S. policy tightening started in 2022, with \nexpectations repeatedly revised higher over time. Meanwhile, most advanced-economy central banks \ncontinue to emphasize that the pace of easing will be cautious, reflecting persistent inflationary \npressures—and, in the case of the United States, robust economic activity. As such, government bond \nyields are well above pre-pandemic levels and are likely to remain so, absent large negative shocks to \ngrowth.   \n \nRisk appetite picked up globally early in the year—particularly in advanced economies— signaling \noptimism that continued steady disinflation might accompany resilient growth. With volatility \nsubdued, advanced economy equity valuations reached elevated levels, especially in the United States, \nwhere confidence regarding potential productivity gains from AI played a key role. Sentiment briefly \nwilted in April, amid firm U.S. inflation data and escalating geopolitical tensions, but rebounded \nthereafter. Although the cost of credit remains high, perceptions of corporate credit risk appear \nmuted—except for asset classes, such as office real estate, that have been adversely affected by \nstructural post-pandemic shifts in activity. Corporate credit spreads remain well below 2010-19 \naverage levels in both the United States and the euro area. Banks in these jurisdictions continue to \nreport tightening of standards for lending to firms, but by markedly narrowing majorities. \n \nEMDE financial conditions also eased in the first quarter of 2024, reflecting expectations of easing \nadvanced-economy monetary conditions, improving global investor sentiment, and ongoing policy \nrate cuts in many large EMDEs. Conditions turned less accommodative early in the second quarter, as \nsafe haven flows and declining expectations of U.S. rate cuts stoked a notable strengthening of the \nU.S. dollar and a bout of debt and equity portfolio outflows. Sovereign spreads have nonetheless \ntrended to below 2010-19 levels in the majority of middle income EMDEs, signalling investor \nconfidence that financial stress risks are broadly contained. In contrast, spreads remain elevated \namong EMDEs with weak credit ratings, even if they have declined substantially this year. \n \nIndeed, despite some easing of global conditions, financial stress concerns remain acute in about 40 \npercent of EMDEs—comprising those with weak credit ratings, and those where debt sustainability \nanalyses indicate a high risk of, or existing, debt distress. Among weakly rated countries that had \nmarket access in the 2010s, a combination of political instability, the pandemic and other external \nshocks, and financial crises in the 2020s has rendered non-concessional debt prohibitively expensive. \nAmong unrated countries—many of them low-income countries—debt burdens have grown \nincreasingly severe owing to a decade of debt build-up in the 2010s, coupled with anemic post-\npandemic recoveries and rising debt-service costs. \n \n(Source: https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/global-economic-prospects) Page 138 of 402 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK \nAfter softening in the second half of 2023, activity in EMDEs generally stabilized in early 2024, with \nindicators of domestic demand, including retail sales and consumer confidence, firming somewhat. In \nearly 2024, headline manufacturing and services sector PMIs broadly moved up, with a still greater \nimprovement in headline manufacturing PMIs for EMDEs excluding China. Economic conditions have \nnonetheless continued to diverge, with ongoing weakness among vulnerable EMDEs. Growth in \ncountries with stronger credit ratings has so far outpaced growth in weaker-rated countries, including \nmany grappling with high debt and financing costs, and in those facing acute challenges, such as \nelevated levels of domestic conflict and violence. \n \nEMDE goods trade growth has shown signs of improvement, with the manufacturing component of \nnew export orders PMIs returning to expansionary territory in early 2024, for the first time since mid-\n2023. In contrast, services exports decelerated in most EMDEs, reflecting an increasingly mature \ntourism recovery following the pandemic. However, countries that lifted pandemic-related restrictions \nlater, mostly in East Asia and Pacific (EAP), continue to see a rebound in tourist flows. \n \nAggregate growth in EMDEs is forecast to edge down from 4.2 percent in 2023 to 4 percent in 2024 \nand remain broadly stable over 2025-26, near estimates of EMDE potential growth for the 2020s. \nHowever, these aggregates mask notable differences in regional trends, with the expected pace of \ngrowth falling short of the 2010-19 average in EAP, ECA, and South Asia (SAR), but returning close to \npre-pandemic averages in other regions over 2025-26, partly owing to still supportive commodity \nprices (box 1.1). Excluding China, EMDE growth is projected to inch up to a still subdued pace of 3.5 \npercent this year, before firming to about 3.9 percent in 2025-26, reflecting a cyclical upswing as \nmonetary policy becomes less restrictive and demand from advanced economies gathers pace.   \n \nIn 2024, the contribution to growth from domestic demand in EMDEs is expected to soften relative to \n2023, before firming over 2025-26. The weaker contribution from domestic demand this year, \nhowever, largely reflects idiosyncratic developments in some of the seven largest EMDEs (EM7), \nfollowing strong performance in 2023. In most of these economies, consumption growth is anticipated \nto decelerate in 2024, as the boost from idiosyncratic factors fades, and then stabilize over 2025-26. \nIn contrast, in other EMDEs, domestic demand is expected to gather pace over the forecast horizon. \nAmong these economies, private consumption is envisaged to rebound in 2024 and further strengthen \nover 2025-26, with declining inflation and interest rates supporting real household incomes and \nconsumer confidence. The rebound in consumption is expected to be broad-based across most \nregions. \n \n(Source: https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/global-economic-prospects) \n \nINDIAN ECONOMIC OVERVIEW \n \nINTRODUCTION \nStrong economic growth in the first quarter of FY 2022-23 helped India overcome the UK to become \nthe fifth-largest economy after it recovered from repeated waves of COVID-19 pandemic shock. Real \nGDP in the first quarter of 2022–23 is currently about 4% higher than its corresponding 2019-20, \nindicating a strong start for India's recovery from the pandemic. Given the release of pent-up demand \nand the widespread vaccination coverage, the contact-intensive services sector will probably be the \nmain driver of development in 2022–2023. Rising employment and substantially increasing private \nconsumption, supported by rising consumer sentiment, will support GDP growth in the coming \nmonths. \n \nFuture capital spending of the government in the economy is expected to be supported by factors such \nas tax buoyancy, the streamlined tax system with low rates, a thorough assessment and rationalisation \nof the tariff structure, and the digitization of tax filing. In the medium run, increased capital spending \non infrastructure and asset-building projects is set to increase growth multipliers, and with the revival \nin monsoon and the Kharif sowing, agriculture is also picking up momentum. The contact-based \nservices sector has largely demonstrated promise to boost growth by unleashing the pent-up demand Page 139 of 402 over the period of April-September 2022. The sector's success is being captured by a number of HFIs \n(High-Frequency Indicators) that are performing well, indicating the beginnings of a comeback. \n \nIndia has emerged as the fastest-growing major economy in the world and is expected to be one of \nthe top three economic powers in the world over the next 10-15 years, backed by its robust democracy \nand strong partnerships. \n \n(Source: https://www.ibef.org/economy/indian-economy-overview) \n \nMARKET SIZE \nReal GDP or GDP at Constant (2011-12) Prices in the year 2023-24 is estimated at Rs. 173.82 lakh crores \n(US$ 2.08 trillion), against the First Revised Estimates (FRE) of GDP for the year 2022-23 of Rs. 160.71 \nlakh crores (US$ 1.92 trillion). The growth in real GDP during 2023-24 is estimated at 8.2% as compared \nto 7.0% in 2022-23. There are 113 unicorn startups in India, with a combined valuation of over US$ \n350 billion. As many as 14 tech startups are expected to list in 2024 Fintech sector poised to generate \nthe largest number of future unicorns in India. With India presently has the third-largest unicorn base \nin the world. The government is also focusing on renewable sources by achieving 40% of its energy \nfrom non-fossil sources by 2030. India is committed to achieving the country's ambition of Net Zero \nEmissions by 2070 through a five-pronged strategy, ‘Panchamrit’. Moreover, India ranked 3rd in the \nrenewable energy country attractive index. \n \nAccording to the McKinsey Global Institute, India needs to boost its rate of employment growth and \ncreate 90 million non-farm jobs between 2023 to 2030 in order to increase productivity and economic \ngrowth. The net employment rate needs to grow by 1.5% per annum from 2023 to 2030 to achieve 8-\n8.5% GDP growth between same time periods. India’s current account deficit (CAD) narrowed to 0.7% \nof GDP in FY24. The CAD stood at US$ 23.2 billion for the 2023-24 compared to US$ 67.0 billion or \n2.0% of GDP in the preceding year. This was largely due to decrease in merchandise trade deficit. \n \nExports fared remarkably well during the pandemic and aided recovery when all other growth engines \nwere losing steam in terms of their contribution to GDP. Going forward, the contribution of \nmerchandise exports may waver as several of India’s trade partners witness an economic slowdown. \nAccording to Minister of Commerce and Industry, Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution and \nTextiles Mr. Piyush Goyal, Indian exports are expected to reach US$ 1 trillion by 2030. \n \n(Source: https://www.ibef.org/economy/indian-economy-overview) \n \nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS \nIndia is primarily a domestic demand-driven economy, with consumption and investments \ncontributing to 70% of the economic activity.

India ranked 5th in foreign direct investment inflows among the developed and \ndeveloping nations listed for the first quarter of 2022. \n \nIndia's economic story during the first half of the current financial year highlighted the unwavering \nsupport the government gave to its capital expenditure, which, in 2023-24, stood 37.4% higher than \nthe same period last year. In the budget of 2023-24, capital expenditure took lead by steeply increasing \nthe capital expenditure outlay by 37.4 % in BE 2023-24 to Rs.10 lakh crore (US$ 120.12 billion) over Rs. \n7.28 lakh crore (US$ 87.45 billion) in RE 2022-23. The ratio of revenue expenditure to capital outlay \nincreased by 1.2% in the current year, signalling a clear change in favour of higher-quality spending. \nStronger revenue generation because of improved tax compliance, increased profitability of the \ncompany, and increasing economic activity also contributed to rising capital spending levels. In Page 144 of 402 February 2024, the Finance Ministry announced the total expenditure in Interim 2024-25 estimated at \nRs. 47,65,768 crore (US$ 571.64 billion) of which total capital expenditure is Rs. 11,11,111 crore (US$ \n133.27 billion). \n \nSince India’s resilient growth despite the global pandemic, India's exports climbed at the second-\nhighest rate with a year-over-year (YoY) growth of 8.39% in merchandise exports and a 29.82% growth \nin service exports till April 2023. With a reduction in port congestion, supply networks are being \nrestored. The CPI-C inflation reduction from June 2022 already reflects the impact. In September 2023 \n(Provisional), CPI-C inflation was 5.02%, down from 7.01% in June 2022. With a proactive set of \nadministrative actions by the government, flexible monetary policy, and a softening of global \ncommodity prices and supply-chain bottlenecks, inflationary pressures in India look to be on the \ndecline overall. \n \nNote: Conversion rate used for January 2024 is Rs.1 = US$ 0.012 (Source: https://www.ibef.org/economy/indian-economy-overview) \n \nINDUSTRY OVERVIEW \n \nIntroduction India is the world’s largest spice producer. It is also the \nlargest consumer and exporter of spices. The production \nof different spices has been growing rapidly over the last \nfew years. Production in 2022-23 stood at 11.14 million \ntonnes compared to 11.12 million tonnes in 2021-22. \nDuring 2022-23, the export of spices from India stood at \nUS$ 3.73 billion from US$ 3.46 billion in 2021-22. During \n2021-22, the single largest spice exported from India \nwas chilli followed by spice oils and oleoresins, mint \nproducts, cumin, and turmeric. India produces about 75 of the 109 varieties which are listed by the International Organization for \nStandardization (ISO). The most produced and exported spices are pepper, cardamom, chilli, ginger, \nturmeric, coriander, cumin, celery, fennel, fenugreek, garlic, nutmeg & mace, curry powder, spice oils \nand oleoresins. Out of these spices, chilli, cumin, turmeric, ginger and coriander makeup about 76% of \nthe total production. \n \nThe largest spices-producing states in India are Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, \nTelangana, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Assam, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and \nKerala. \n \nExports Trend India is the largest exporter of spice and spice items. During \n2023-24 (until February 2024), the country exported spices \nworth US$ 3.67 billion. \n \nFor FY23, the country exported spices worth US$ 3.73 \nbillion. In July 2023, the exports of spices from India \nincreased to US$ 298.77 million from US$ 293.84 million in \nJune 2023. From 2016-17 to 2022-23, the total exported \nquantity from India grew at a CAGR of 5.85%. \n \nFor FY23, total volumes of chilli, cumin, turmeric, and ginger \nexports were 0.51, 0.18, 0.17 and 0.05 million tonnes. \n \nDuring 2022-23, the export of turmeric, coriander, garlic, curry powder, other spices such as \nasafoetida, tamarind, etc., expanded both in value and volume as compared to 2021-22. Page 145 of 402 Major Export Destinations \nIndia exported spices and spice products to 159 destinations worldwide as of 2023-24 (until February \n2024). The top destinations among them were China, the USA, Bangladesh, the UAE, Thailand, \nMalaysia, Indonesia, the UK, and Sri Lanka.

FMCG sector provides employment to around 3 million people \naccounting for approximately 5% of the total factory employment in India. FMCG sales in the country \ngrew 7-9% by revenues in 2022-23. The key growth drivers for the sector include favourable \nGovernment initiatives & policies, a growing rural market and youth population, new branded \nproducts, and growth of e-commerce platforms. Resilience needs to be the key factor in the \nmanufacturing process, daily operations, retail and logistic channels, consumer insights and \ncommunication that will help FMCG companies to withstand the test of time and create more value \nfor consumers in the long run. India’s fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector grew 7.5% by \nvolumes in the April-June 2023 quarter, the highest in the last eight quarters, led by a revival in rural \nIndia and higher growth in modern trade. \n \nCRISIL forecasts 7-9% revenue growth for the FMCG sector in the current FY25, driven by increased \nvolume and rural demand recovery. Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector is India’s fourth-\nlargest sector and has been expanding at a healthy rate over the years because of rising disposable \nincome, a rising youth population, and rising brand awareness among consumers. \n \nWith household and personal care accounting for 50% of FMCG sales in India, the industry is an \nimportant contributor to India’s GDP. \n \nIndia is a country that no FMCG player can afford to ignore due to its middle-class population which is \nlarger than the total population of USA. The Indian FMCG market continues to rise as more people \nstart to move up the economic ladder and the benefits of economic progress become accessible to the \npublic. More crucially, with a median age of just 27, India's population is becoming more consumerist \ndue to rising ambitions. This has been further aided by government initiatives to increase financial \ninclusion and establish social safety nets. \n \nGrowing awareness, easier access and changing lifestyles have been the key growth drivers for the \nsector. The urban segment (accounts for a revenue share of around 65%) is the largest contributor to \nthe overall revenue generated by the FMCG sector in India. However, in the last few years, the FMCG \nmarket has grown at a faster pace in rural India compared to urban India. Semi-urban and rural \nsegments are growing at a rapid pace and FMCG products account for 50% of the total rural spending. Page 146 of 402 Market Size Total revenue of FMCG market is expected to grow at a \nCAGR of 27.9% through 2021-27, reaching nearly US$ \n615.87 billion. In 2022, urban segment contributed 65% \nwhereas rural India contributed more than 35% to the \noverall annual FMCG sales. Good harvest, government \nspending expected to aid rural demand recovery in FY24. \nThe sector had grown 8.5% in revenues and 2.5% in \nvolumes last fiscal year. In the January-June period of \n2022, the sector witnessed value growth of about 8.4% on \naccount of price hikes due to inflationary pressures. In \nthird quarter of FY23, the FMCG sector clocked a value \ngrowth of 9.0% YoY — lower than the 9.2% YoY value \ngrowth seen in third quarter of FY22. \n \nAs per CRISIL, India's dairy industry is projected to experience a healthy revenue growth of 13-14% in \nFY25, driven by strong consumer demand and increased raw milk supply. \n \nAccording to NielsenIQ’s report, in 2024, the FMCG industry in India is expected to grow between 4.5-\n6.5%, owing to strength in the sector and Indian economy. \n \nIndian food processing market size reached US$ 307.2 billion in 2022 and is expected to reach US$ 470 \nbillion by 2028, exhibiting a growth rate (CAGR) of 9.5% during 2023-2028. \n \nThe Union government approved a new PLI scheme for the food processing sector, with a budget \noutlay of Rs. 109 billion (US$ 1.46 billion). Incentives under the scheme will be disbursed for six years \nto 2026-27. \n \nIndia’s FMCG sector has long been the top spender in the country’s advertising market, commanding \nnearly one third share Rs. 31,000 Crore (US$ 3.75 billion) in 2023 of the total advertising expenditure. \nIndia includes 780 million internet users, where an average Indian person spends around 7.3 hours per \nday on their smartphone, one of the highest in the world. Number of active internet users in India will \nincrease to 900 million by 2025 from 759 million in 2022. In 2022, India’s consumer spending was US$ \n2,049.57 billion. Indian villages, which contribute more than 35% to overall annual FMCG sales, are \ncrucial for overall revival of the sector. E-commerce now accounts for 17% of the overall FMCG \nconsumption among evolved buyers, who are affluent and make average spends of about Rs. 5,620 \n(US$ 677.11 million). \n \nThe Indian e-commerce market is anticipated to grow from US$ 83 billion in 2022 to US$ 185 billion in \n2026. By 2030, it is expected to have an annual gross merchandise value of US$ 350 billion. Fuelling e-\ncommerce growth, India is expected to have over 907 million internet users by 2023, which accounts \nfor 64% of the total population of the country. \n \nThe market has grown exponentially over the past five years due to the surge in internet and \nsmartphone users, improved policy reforms, and increase in disposable income. Mobile wallets, \nInternet banking, and debit/credit cards have become popular among customers for making \ntransactions on e-commerce platforms. The total value of digital transactions stood at US$ 300 billion \nin 2021 and is projected to reach US$ 1 trillion by 2026. \n \nThe India online grocery market size has been projected to grow from US$ 4,540 million in 2022 to \nUS$ 76,761.0 million by 2032, at a CAGR of 32.7% through 2032. \n \nFMCG giants such as Johnson & Johnson, Himalaya, Hindustan Unilever, ITC, Lakmé and other \ncompanies (that have dominated the Indian market for decades) are now competing with D2C-focused \nstart-ups such as Mamaearth, The Moms Co., Bey Bee, Azah, Nua and Pee Safe. Market giants such as Page 147 of 402 Revlon and Lotus took 20 years to reach the Rs. 100 crore (US$ 13.4 million) revenue mark, while new-\nage D2C brands such as Mamaearth and Sugar took four and eight years, respectively, to achieve that \nmilestone. \n \nRecent Developments \n1.

One Nation One Ration Card: Introduction: The implementation of nation-wide portability of \nration cards through “One Nation One Ration Card \n(ONORC)” scheme, is an endeavour of the \nDepartment of Food & Public Distribution, \nGovernment of India to empower about 81 crore \nbeneficiaries. This plan has been launched under \nthe National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, \nwhich aims to ensure that anyone can take their \nshare of food grains from any district of any state \nof the country. Objective: \n• Through this facility, while a migrant beneficiary is able to get ration at the destination he or she is working in, his/her family back home is also allowed to get their part of the entitled ration to \nsupport itself. \n• This system provides flexibility to all NFSA beneficiaries to lift their foodgrains from any FPS (Fair Price Shop) of their choice. \n \nNeed: \n• Owing to the defined coverage of beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013 in each State/UT, it was difficult for migrant beneficiaries to get a new ration card issued. Even if \nthey were able to get one issued, it introduced the ‘duplicity’ of ration cards/beneficiaries in the \ncountry’s Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS), thereby potentially depriving many other \nleft-out and genuinely deserving beneficiaries from getting included under the fold of NFSA. \n• Now problems of getting a new ration card and duplicity of beneficiaries are solved and the government is enabling the inclusion of all genuine beneficiaries of State/UT through portability \nunder the fold of NFSA. \n• This mechanism can plug the leakage/diversion of un-lifted foodgrains in FPSs, as they can now be lifted by their rightful beneficiaries through portability and gets adjusted between States/UTs, \nthereby minimizing the chances of diversion. \n \nTechnology Driven Scheme: \n• The scheme enables migrant beneficiaries to get their food grains from a FPS of their choice in most parts of the country, by using their same/existing ration card with biometric authentication of \nidentity on an Electronic Point of Sale (e-PoS) device \n• This system of portability is being implemented in all states and Union Territories where the system is being built upon the strong foundations of computerized Targeted Public Distribution System Page 149 of 402 (TPDS) operations. This includes the installed infrastructure of ePoS devices at the FPS and seeding \nof beneficiaries’ Aadhaar numbers with their ration cards. \n• A copy of either the Ration card or Aadhar card is acceptable. Beneficiaries can simply tell either their Ration card number or seeded Aadhar number to the FPS dealer to receive their ration. \n• The Department of Food & Public Distribution, in association with NIC, has launched a Mobile Application “MERA RATION” for the benefit of NFSA beneficiaries, particularly migrant \nbeneficiaries, to take maximum advantage of the One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) plan. \n• Currently, the ‘Mera Ration’ mobile application is available in 12 languages. \n• On it, other information like registration of migrants, details of available entitlements, location of nearby FPS, information on past transactions, eligibility criteria, list of ONORC states, etc. can be \naccessed. \n \nOutcomes of ONORC: \n• The broad-based reform of portability covering nearly 81 Crore NFSA beneficiaries in all States/UTs is being achieved with minimal outlay of just Rs. 127 Crore, over a period of 4 years. \n• This is a one-of- its-kind Citizen-Centric initiative in the country, swiftly implemented in34 States/UTs in a short-span of time (as of August 2021), after being sanctioned in 2018-19 and \nimplemented from August 2019. \n• ONORC was helpful to NFSA beneficiaries in availing food grains from any location during COVID pandemic/ lockdown period. \n• During the period between 01-April-2020 and 30-September-2021, about 24.32 crore portability transactions under NFSA were carried out across States/UTs, benefiting large number of NFSA \nbeneficiaries, mostly migrants, at the Fair Price Shops (FPS) near to their location of \nwork/temporary stay. \n• Under the NSFA, almost 23.6 crore Ration cards have been digitized to cover 80 crore beneficiaries of all states/UTs. \n• Almost 93.1 % Ration Cards and 90.1 % beneficiaries are Aadhar-seeded at a national level. \n• Online allocation orders for food grains for all FPS has been implemented in all states/UTs, besides Chandigarh and Puducherry. \n• Supply Chain Management of food grains is computerized in 31 States/UTs for online management of stocks in godowns and its in-and-out movement. \n \n(Source: https://pib.gov.in/factsheetdetails.aspx?id=148563) 2. Mid-day meal The National Programme of Nutritional Support to Primary Education (NP-NSPE) which is popularly \nknown as the Mid-day Meal Scheme was launched by the Government of India in 1995. NP-NSPE \nstates that it aims to address “classroom hunger” and encourage poor children, belonging to \ndisadvantaged sections, to attend school regularly and help them concentrate on classroom \nactivities. The mid-day meal programme is a multi-faceted programme of the Government of India \nthat, among other things, also seeks to address issues of food security, lack of nutrition and access \nto education on a nationwide scale. The Scheme is the world’s largest school feeding programme \nreaching out to about 12 crore children in over 12.65 lakh schools/EGS centres across the country. \n \nThe level of malnutrition is of great concern in India with over 40% of children being classified as \nundernourished. Anaemia affects over 3/4th of the school children due to low intake of iron and \nfolic acid. The reasons for such high levels of malnutrition and anaemia are complex. They include \npoverty, gender inequity, specific dietary patterns and recurrent illness, all these acting in \nconjunction. \n \nSchool feeding programmes are popular in the developing world and beyond, not only because of \ntheir educational but also for their nutritional benefits. Mid-day meal acts as a regular source of \n“supplementary nutrition” for children, which facilitates their healthy growth.

Recently (September \n2021), the Government renamed this scheme to Pradhan Mantri Poshan Shakti Nirman or ‘PM \nPOSHAN’. Each alteration in name brings some changes in the scheme. \n \nUnder the Midday Meal Scheme in India, around 11.80 crore children (in 11.20 lakh government \nand government-aided schools) will get hot cooked food. However, under the new scheme ‘PM POSHAN’, 24 lakhs of children studying in pre-primary \nschools who are already covered under the Integrated Child Development Services will get food \nunder the MDM scheme. \n \nThe PM Poshan will be operational initially for 5 years (2021-22 to 2025-26). Here, the Central \nGovernment will take responsibility for Rs. 54,061 crores of the total approximate expenditure \nof Rs. 1.3 lakh crore.

SPICED Scheme Spices Board, under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, has launched a transformative scheme \naimed at significantly enhancing the export of spices and value- added spice products as well as \nimproving the productivity of cardamoms and upgrading the post-harvest quality of spices across \nIndia for export. \n \nVarious programmes rolled out under the scheme 'Sustainability in Spice Sector through \nProgressive, Innovative and Collaborative Interventions for Export Development (SPICED)' will be \nimplemented during the remaining period of the 15th Finance Commission cycle, till FY 2025-26, \nwith a total approved outlay of Rs. 422.30 crore. \n \nThe SPICED scheme is expected to facilitate value addition and to drive innovation and \nsustainability in the spice sector by introducing new sub-components/programs like the Mission \nValue Addition, Mission Clean and Safe Spices, promotion of GI spices, support for \nentrepreneurship through Spice Incubation Centres, etc. The scheme gives thrust on farmers \ngroups / FPOS / Farmers Clusters identified under ODOP and DEH, SC/ST community, Exporters \nfrom NE region, and SMEs. \n \nThe programs under the components such as Improving the productivity of cardamom and post-\nharvest quality upgradation of spices are specifically designed to empower farmer groups, including \nFarmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), Farmer Producer Companies (FPCs), and Self-Help Groups \n(SHGs) in key spice-growing regions. These groups will be prioritized for post-harvest improvement Page 151 of 402 of spices, with targeted assistance provided to enhance creation of an exportable surplus of spices, \nin compliance with the applicable food safety and quality standards. \n \nThe programs for cardamom focuses on increasing the productivity of both small and large \ncardamom through replanting efforts, production of quality planting material, developing water \nsources, adopting micro-irrigation systems, etc. Additionally, there are programs to promote \nweather-based insurance to protect farmers' interests. Similarly, post-harvest quality improvement \nof spices is addressed through programs such as Mission Clean and Safe Spices through post-\nharvest improvement by groups in identified clusters, promotion of sustainable production and \ncertification systems and extension advisory services. \n \nIn a move to further strengthen value addition in the spice sector, the Board is introducing \ncomponents such as Enhancing capacities for market expansion, Trade promotion, and \nTechnological interventions. These components offer support for technological and infrastructural \ninterventions for processing and value addition of spices, setting up or upgradation of in-house \nlaboratories, product development, market development & branding, and implementation of food \nsafety & quality assurance mechanisms, all aimed at improving India's global competitiveness in \nthe spice sector. To strengthen trade promotion efforts, programs have been designed to support \nparticipation in international fairs, buyer-seller meets, and for promotion of GI-tagged spices in \ndomestic and global markets.

L. Dangayach and Company, \nChartered Accountants \n \nREVENUE MODEL \n \nWe operate on a multiple sales channel model the details of which are as under: \n \n1. Business to Business (B2B): B2B sales involve selling our products to other businesses, which may use them or sell them to their own customers. The different type of revenue model in B2B sales is \nas under: \n \n• \nGeneral Trade: General or traditional trade can be defined as the trade conducted by local stores \nor shops that cater to the needs of local consumers. These typically include wholesalers and \ndistributors. They work to satisfy the typical requirements of the end consumer and deal with \nsmall amounts of products. Our company works with a network of approximately 389 wholesalers \ndistributors across India as on September 30, 2025. These distributors play a key role in marketing \nour products through their own sales teams, while our company provides additional support via \nour marketing personnel. Our company sell our products to these distributors, who then resells \nour products to local markets and small retailers. This model generates revenue through \nwholesale bulk sales, with distributors marking up the products for retail. \n \n• \nModern Trade: Modern trade is a more structured and sophisticated system of chain retailers like \nmini-markets, supermarkets, and hypermarkets. They are found only in cities and are typically \ncorporate-owned. Our company focuses on establishing relationships with large retail chains and \nsupermarket giants like D-Mart, Metro Cash & Carry, Reliance Retail and Dealshare. Our company \ndirectly sells to these retail chains, where it places products for consumer purchase. A dedicated \nteam of 121 sales and marketing professionals is employed to work specifically within these \nstores, driving visibility, sales, and ensuring the products are well-presented to consumers. In this \nmodel, revenue is earned by selling products at wholesale prices to these large retailers, while \nthe retailers mark up prices for consumer sales. Additionally, in-store promotions and bulk \ndiscounts may be utilized to increase sales volumes. • \nQuick Commerce: Quick Commerce enables us to tap into the growing trend of on-demand \ndelivery through platforms such as Flipkart Minutes, Swiggy Instamart, Blinkit and Zepto. In this \nmodel, we supply products to the Distribution Centres (DCs) of these platforms, from where \ncustomer orders are efficiently fulfilled and delivered. We enter into contracts with these \nplatforms for product listings and agrees on pricing terms. Sales are driven through commission-\nbased models, where platforms charge a fee per transaction. This model enables us to reach tech-\nsavvy urban consumers looking who prioritize speed and convenience, further expanding our \nbrand presence in the fast-growing digital retail space. • \nPrivate Labelling: This refers to a business arrangement where we manufacture and process \nproducts but package them under our customers brand names. This allows our customers to offer \ngood-quality spices without investing in production. We provide flexible packaging options like \npouches, jars, and bulk packs, with customizable minimum order quantities to accommodate \nbusinesses of all sizes. This model helps us to reach new markets, increase sales volume through Page 157 of 402 larger orders, and build long-term client partnerships. It also allows us to focus on our strength \nof producing and processing good quality spices, while our clients manage marketing and \ndistribution, ensuring steady growth and market adaptability. \n \n• \nHORECA Sales: The HoReCa sector includes Hotels, Restaurants, and Catering, where we provide \nbulk spice solutions tailored to chefs and foodservice providers. We begin by understanding our \nclients' specific needs, whether custom spice blends or bulk packaging, and ensure good quality, \nfresh products with consistent flavour. Our packaging is designed for bulk use, and we focus on \ntimely deliveries. Engaging in the HoReCa business allows for larger sales volumes, stable \nrevenue, increased brand exposure, and product innovation, helping us meet emerging culinary \ntrends and build long-term client relationships. \n \n• \nExports sales: Under this revenue model our company exports its products to various \ninternational distributors and importers situated in multiple countries across the globe such as \nMongolia, Nepal, Oman, Saudi Arabia, UAE. Private labelling also helps us to strengthen our \nexport presence by tailoring products to suit international markets, opening up new global \nopportunities Our company generates revenue by selling bulk orders to these international \ncustomers. 2. Direct to Consumer (D2C): This means a business model where a company sells products or services directly to end-users (consumers) without intermediaries. Our company is involved in D2C sales \nthrough the following: \n \n• \nWebsite Sales: Our company have a dedicated website which allows the customers to directly \nmake a purchase, pay for them and can get them delivered at their preferred locations. This allows \nus to increase our profit margins as customers can directly buy from us thus eliminating the \nmiddlemen.

Only chillies that meet industry standards are accepted \nfor further processing, while non-compliant batches are rejected. Approved dried chillies are then \ntransferred to raw material storage. \n \n❖ Cleaning and Sorting:  Before processing, the stemps of all the dried chillies are removed in order to preserve the colour as well as maintain the spiceness. Post this stemp removal process, the dried \nchillies are thoroughly cleaned and sorted to remove dirt, cut stems, stones, and other foreign \nimpurities. Various cleaning methods, such as sieving or air blowing are used to ensure purity. After \ncleaning, the dried chillies are sorted manually or using automated systems to separate them based \non size, color, and quality. This ensures consistency in the final chilli powder. \n \n❖ Grinding and Refining of Raw Material: After cleaning, the chillies undergo a three-step grinding process to achieve the desired fine powder consistency: Grinder 1: Initial size reduction of dried chilies. \nGrinder 2: Further refinement to break down coarse particles.  \nGrinding 3: Final grinding to achieve uniform fine chili power. \n \n❖ Oil Addition and Mixing: After the grinding process, the edible oil is received from the suppliers and undergoes a quality inspection to ensure it meets the required standards. Once approved, the \noil is mixed thoroughly with the ground chili powder to achieve the desired consistency and quality. Page 168 of 402 ❖ Final Processing of Raw Material: After the oil mixing stage, the chilli powder undergoes a vibration process to eliminate air pockets and ensure uniform distribution of the material. This step enhances \nproduct consistency and quality. Next, the powder is further refined using a super mill, which \nimproves texture, smoothness, and overall finish. To ensure safety and purity, the powder then \nundergoes magnetic separation, effectively removing any potential metallic contaminants. This \nfinal step ensures that the chilli powder meets the quality and safety standards before packaging. \n \n❖ Storage of Grounded and Cooled Materials: Once processed, the chilli powder is stored in a designated area under controlled conditions to maintain its color, aroma, and pungency. For \ntemperature-sensitive batches, the powder is transferred to outsourced cold storage facilities. \n \n❖ Packaging: The chilli powder is then packaged in various formats, such as sachets, jars, bottles, or bulk packs, depending on market requirements. Packaging is done in a hygienic environment to \nprevent contamination and preserve the product’s freshness. Advanced techniques like vacuum \nsealing or nitrogen flushing may be used to extend shelf life. \n \n❖ Labeling and Quality Control: Before market release, the packaged chili powder undergos rigorous quality control checks. This includes testing for: • \nPurity \n• \nManufacturing and Expiration Dates \n• \nColor and texture \n• \nAroma and taste \n• \nPesticide residues etc. \n \nEach package is then labeled with essential details such as the name, ingredients, manufacturer’s \ninformation, expiry date, and other legal information. \n \n❖ Storage and Distribution: The final packaged chilli powder is stored in a cool, dry, and dark environment to maintain its vibrant color and spicy flavor. Once ready, it is distributed to \nwholesalers, distributors and customers, ensuring timely delivery and optimal product quality. \n \n➢ Coriander Powder: Page 169 of 402 Details of the processing Process is as under: \n \n❖ Raw Material Procurement and Quality Control: The process begins with the receipt of Raw Materials (RM) i.e. coriander seeds, followed by Inspection to assess their quality. If they meet the \nQuality Control (QC) standards, they are transferred to Raw Material Storage. If they fail QC, they \nare returned to the supplier. \n \n❖ Cleaning Process for Raw Materials: To ensure the good quality, the coriander seeds undergo a three-step cleaning process: • \nInitial Cleaning: Removal of loose dust and debris. • \nInspection & Contaminant Removal: Larger impurities and foreign materials are eliminated. • \nFinal Cleaning: Specialized techniques are used to achieve the desired purity and cleanliness. \n \n❖ Grinding and Refinement of Raw Materials: Once cleaned, the coriander seeds are transferred to Grinder 1, where they are ground using Hammer Mill 1. The semi-processed material is then further \nrefined in Grinder 2 with Hammer Mill 2 for finer grinding. After this stage, the powdered coriander \npasses through a Vibro Sifter, ensuring uniform texture and quality. \n \n❖ Metal Detection, Storage, and Transfer to Semi-Finished Goods: To maintain product safety, the coriander powder undergoes metal detection to identify and remove any contaminants. The \nrefined powder is then stored in Ground Storage and Cold Storage to preserve freshness. From \nground storage, it is transferred to the Semi-Finished Goods section for further processing. \n \n❖ Packaging, Storage, and Final Dispatch of Finished Goods: In the final stage, the coriander powder is packed in appropriate packaging materials to maintain its quality and shelf life. The packaged \ngoods are then moved to Storage and eventually Dispatch to their final destination. ➢ Turmeric Powder: Details of the processing Process is as under: ❖ Raw Material Handling and Quality Control: The process begins with the receipt of Raw Materials (RM) i.e. dried turmeric rhizomes, followed by Inspection to assess their quality. If they Page 170 of 402 meet the Quality Control (QC) standards, they are transferred to Raw Material Storage. If they \nfail QC, they are returned to the supplier or inn cases of quality issues Pillage and Destruction \nprocesses are implemented for the non-compliant materials. \n \n❖ Two-Step Cleaning Process for Raw Materials: To ensure purity and quality, the dried turmeric rhizomes undergo a two-step cleaning process: • \nCleaning 1: Removal of dust, sand, and other loose particles. \n• \nCleaning 2: Manual inspection to eliminate any remaining impurities or foreign materials. \n \n❖ Grinding and Refinement Process for Raw Materials: After thorough cleaning, the dried turmeric rhizomes are transferred for grinding, where they are processed to achieve the desired texture. \nThe ground material is then passed through a Vibro Sifter to ensure uniform consistency. Following \nthis, a metal detector is used to eliminate any potential metal contaminants, ensuring product \nsafety. ❖ Final Inspection and Storage of Processed Materials: A final quality inspection is performed before storage. The processed turmeric powder is then stored in Ground Storage and Cold Storage to \nmaintain freshness. From Ground Storage, the materials are transferred to the Semi-Finished \nGoods section for further processing. \n \n❖ Packaging, Storage, and Dispatch of Finished Goods: Once the turmeric powder meets the required standards, it is moved to the Packaging section. The packaged product is then stored in \nFinished Goods Storage before being dispatched to its final destination. \n \nCAPACITY UTILIZATION \n \nThe details of Installed capacity and capacity utilization of our manufacturing unit is as under: (Quantity In MT) \nS. \nNo. \nPERIOD \nLOCATION \nNAME OF PRODUCT \nUNIT MEASUREMENT INSTALLED ACTUAL \nPRODUCTION CAPACITY \nUTILIZATION IN % OF PRODUCTION CAPACITY GROUND SPICES \nMT \n   3,360.00  \n2,218.97  \n66.04% \nBLENDED SPICES \nMT \n      480.00  \n64.19  \n13.37% \nWHOLE SPICES \nMT \n   1,380.00  \n197.22  \n14.29% \nGROCERY PRODUCTS \nMT \n   1,380.00  \n206.59  \n14.97% JATAWALI, 1 \nFY 2022-23 CHOMU, JAIPUR GROUND SPICES \nMT \n   3,675.00  \n2,507.38  \n68.23% \nBLENDED SPICES \nMT \n      480.00  \n478.28  \n99.64% \nWHOLE SPICES \nMT \n   1,380.00  \n843.34  \n61.11% \nGROCERY PRODUCTS \nMT \n   1,380.00  \n499.16  \n36.17% JATAWALI, 2 \nFY 2023-24 CHOMU, JAIPUR GROUND SPICES \nMT \n8,760.00(1)(2) \n4,531.17 \n51.73% \nBLENDED SPICES \nMT \n3,120.00(1)(2) \n478.12 \n15.32% \nWHOLE SPICES \nMT \n6,180.00(1)(2) \n729.33 \n11.80% \nGROCERY PRODUCTS \nMT \n1,380.00(1)(2) \n493.00 \n35.72% JATAWALI, 3 \nFY 2024-25 CHOMU, JAIPUR GROUND SPICES \nMT \n8,760.00 \n1,642.26 \n18.75% \nBLENDED SPICES \nMT \n3,120.00 \n213.61 \n6.85% \nWHOLE SPICES \nMT \n6,180.00 \n472.75 \n7.65% \nGROCERY PRODUCTS \nMT \n1,380.00 \n367.47 \n26.63% \nCapacity Utilization is pursuant to the Certificate dated December 04, 2025 from Bidadhar & Techno Associates Chartered Engineer Certificate No. \nBTA/IND/121/2025. \n(1) The installed capacity of Ground Spices increased by 765 MT and enhanced capacity was operational from 01.04.2024 \n(2) The installed capacity of Ground Spices, Blended Spices and Whole Spices was further increased by 4320 MT, 2640 MT and 4800 MT and the enhanced capacity April 01, 2025 \nto September \n30, 2025 JATAWALI, 4 CHOMU, JAIPUR was operational from 29.03.2025. \n \nDETAILS OF OUR BUSINESS LOCATIONS \n \nRegistered and Corporate Office: The registered office of our company is situated at F438A, Road No. \n12, Vishwakarma Industrial Area, Jaipur, Rajasthan 302013.

For details, please see chapter titled “Outstanding Litigation and Material Developments – Litigation \nInvolving Our Company” on page 296-297. Page 179 of 402 KEY INDUSTRY REGULATIONS AND POLICIES \n \nThe following description is a summary of the relevant regulations and policies as prescribed by the \nGovernment of India and other regulatory bodies that are applicable to our business. The information \ndetailed in this chapter has been obtained from various legislations, including rules and regulations \npromulgated by the regulatory bodies that are available in the public domain. The regulations and \npolicies set out below may not be exhaustive and are only intended to provide general information to \nthe investors and are neither designed nor intended to be a substitute for professional legal advice. Our \nCompany may be required to obtain licenses and approvals depending upon the prevailing laws and \nregulations as applicable. For details of such approvals, please see the section titled “Government and \nStatutory Approvals” beginning on page 302.  \n \nINDUSTRY/BUSINESS/TRADE RELATED LAWS \n \nThe Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (“FSSA”) \nThe Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (“FSSA”) was enacted to establish a comprehensive \nregulatory framework for food safety in India, replacing the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954. \nThe Act led to the formation of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), which sets \nscientific standards for food products and regulates their manufacture, storage, distribution, sale, and \nimport to ensure consumer safety. The regulatory framework mandates that all food business \noperators obtain necessary licenses and comply with prescribed safety and quality standards. \nAdditionally, the Food Safety and Standards Rules, 2011 (“FSSR”) provide detailed guidelines on the \nregistration and licensing of food businesses, enforcement mechanisms, and roles of food safety \nofficers and analysts. The law also places liability on manufacturers, distributors, and retailers to \nensure that food products meet quality and safety benchmarks and prohibits the sale of misbranded \nor unsafe products. \n \nIn addition to these regulations, the FSSAI has issued several guidelines to address emerging challenges \nin food safety, including the Guidance Note on Food Hygiene and Safety during the COVID-19 \nPandemic. This Guidance Note outlines preventive measures for food businesses, including health \nscreenings, disinfection protocols, and hygiene standards, to mitigate contamination risks. The FSSA \nframework plays a critical role in ensuring food safety, strengthening regulatory compliance, and \nfostering consumer trust in the food industry. \n \nLegal Metrology Act, 2009 (“LM Act”) \nThe Legal Metrology Act, 2009 replaced the Standards of Weights & Measures Act, 1976 and the \nStandards of Weights & Measures (Enforcement) Act, 1985 to establish a uniform system of weights \nand measures in line with international standards. India, as a member of the International \nOrganization of Legal Metrology (“OIML”), adopted the SI units to ensure accuracy and consistency in \ntrade and commerce. The Act regulates inter-state trade, mandates the approval of weighing and \nmeasuring instruments, and establishes standards for numeration to prevent malpractices in \ntransactions. It also provides for the Indian Institute of Legal Metrology to train enforcement officers \nand prescribes penalties for non-compliance. \n \nThe Legal Metrology Act is essential to ensure that all pre-packaged goods meet prescribed labelling \nand measurement standards. This includes accurate declaration of weight, quantity, MRP, \nmanufacturing details, and consumer grievance information on packaging. The Act mandates \nregistration of weighing and measuring instruments used in manufacturing and retail, ensuring \ntransparency and fair trade practices. Non-compliance can result in penalty, making adherence to legal \nmetrology regulations a critical aspect of business operations for consumer protection and regulatory \ncompliance. \n \nLegal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011 (“Packaged Commodities Rules”) \nhe Packaged Commodities Rules was framed under Section 52(2) (j) and (q) of the Metrology Act and \nlay down specific provisions applicable to packages intended for retail sale, whole sale and for export Page 180 of 402 and import. A “pre packaged commodity” means a commodity which without the purchaser being \npresent is placed in a package of a pre-determined quantity. The key provisions of the Packaged \nCommodities Rules are: \n• It is illegal to manufacture, pack, sell, import, distribute, deliver, offer, expose or possess for sale any pre‐packaged commodity unless the package is in such standard quantities or number and \nbears thereon such declarations and particulars as prescribed.  \n• All pre‐packaged commodities must conform to the declarations provided thereon as per the requirement of Section 18(1) of the Metrology Act; and  \n• No pre‐packaged commodity shall be packed with error in net quantity beyond the limit prescribed in the first schedule of the Packaged Commodity Rules. \n \nThe Spices Board Act, 1986 \nThe Spices Board Act, 1986 was enacted to establish the Spices Board of India, a regulatory body under \nthe ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India. The Act consolidated the functions of \nthe erstwhile Cardamom Board and Spices Export Promotion Council, with the objective of promoting, \ndeveloping, and regulating the spice industry in India. The Board is responsible for overseeing the \nproduction, processing, and export of spices, ensuring quality control, certification, and adherence to \ninternational standards. It also provides financial and technical assistance to farmers, exporters, and \nother stakeholders in the spice industry. \n \nThe Board's regulatory framework ensures compliance with both domestic and international food \nsafety standards, making it essential for companies involved in the manufacturing, processing, and \nexport of spices.   \n \nAgricultural Produce (Grading and Marketing) Act, 1937 (Agmark)  \nThe agricultural produce marketing legislations enacted by state governments regulate marketing of \nagricultural, horticultural, livestock products and certain other produce in market areas and \nestablishes market committees for every market area in the state to regulate transactions in \nagricultural produce. It provides for the organization and composition of committees and their powers \nand functions which include, granting licenses to operate in the market, provide for necessary facilities \nin the market area, regulate and control transactions in the market and admissions to the market.  \n \nThe Directorate of Marketing and Inspection enforces the Agricultural Produce (Grading and \nMarketing) Act, 1937. Under this Act Grade standards are prescribed for agricultural and allied \ncommodities. These are known as Agmark' standards. Grading under the provisions of this Act is \nvoluntary. The DMI enforces the Agricultural Products (Grading and Marketing) Act, 1937. Under this \nAct, Grade Standards are prescribed for agricultural and allied commodities. These are known as \n\"Agmark\" Standards. Grading under the provisions of this Act is voluntary. Manufacturers who comply \nwith standard laid down by DMI are allowed to use \"Agmark\" labels on their products. \n \nThe Essential Commodities Act, 1955  \nThe Essential Commodities Act, 1955 (“ECA”) gives powers to the Government of India to control the \nproduction, supply and distribution of certain essential commodities for inter alia securing their \nequitable distribution and availability at fair prices. Using the powers under it, various ministries/ \ndepartments of the Indian government have issued control orders for regulating production, \ndistribution, trading, quality aspects, movement and prices pertaining to commodities which are \nessential and administered by them, including for essential commodities such as food grains, edible \noils, sugar and drugs. Penalties in terms of fine and imprisonment are prescribed under the ECA for \nnon-compliance of its provisions. \n \nThe Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 (“Amendment Act”), which is yet to be \nimplemented, provides the Government of India to regulate the supply of certain food items including \nedible oils only under extraordinary circumstances which may include war, famine, extraordinary price \nrise and natural calamity of grave nature. The Amendment Act requires that imposition of any stock \nlimit on agricultural produce must be based on price rise. Further, a stock limit may be imposed only Page 181 of 402 if there is: (i) a 100% increase in retail price of horticultural produce; and (ii) a 50% increase in the \nretail price of non-perishable agricultural food items. The increase will be calculated over the price \nprevailing immediately preceding twelve months, or the average retail price of the last five years, \nwhichever is lower. \n \nSTATUTORY AND COMMERCIAL LAWS \n \nThe Companies Act, 2013 and Companies Act, 1956 \nThe Companies Act, 2013, has replaced the Companies Act, 1956, in a phased manner. The Companies \nAct, 2013 received the assent of the President of India on August 29, 2013. At present, almost all the \nprovisions of this law have been made effective except a few to which extent the Companies Act, 1956, \nis still applicable. The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has also issued rules complementary to the \nCompanies Act, 2013 establishing the procedure to be followed by companies in order to comply with \nthe substantive provisions of the Companies Act, 2013. The Companies Act primarily regulates the \nformation, financing, functioning, and winding up of companies. The Companies Act, 2013 prescribes \nregulatory mechanisms regarding all relevant aspects including organizational, financial and \nmanagerial aspects of companies. Indian Contract Act, 1872 \nThe Indian Contract Act, 1872 (“Contract Act”) codifies the way in which a contract is entered, \nexecuted, and implemented and the implications of a breach of a contract. The Contract Act consists \nof limiting factors subject to which contract may be entered into, executed and breach enforced, as \namended from time to time. It determines the circumstances in which a promise made by the parties \nto a contract shall be legally binding on them. Each contract creates some rights and duties upon the \ncontracting parties. The Contract Act deals with the enforcement of these rights and duties upon the \nparties. The Contract Act also lays down provisions of indemnity, guarantee, bailment, and agency. \nProvisions relating to the sale of goods and partnerships which were originally in the Act are now the \nsubject matter of separate enactments viz., the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 and the Indian Partnership Act \n1932. The objective of the Contract Act is to ensure that the rights and obligations arising out of a \ncontract are honoured and that legal remedies are made available to those who are affected. \n \nThe Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \nThe Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 cover Insolvency of companies, Limited Liability \npartnerships (LLPs), unlimited liability partnerships, and individuals. The IBC 2016 has laid down a \ncollective mechanism for resolution of insolvencies in the country by maintaining a delicate balance \nfor all stakeholders to preserve the economic value of the process in a time bound manner. The code \nempowers any creditor of a Corporate Debtor (CD), irrespective of it being a Financial Creditor (FC) or \nOperational Creditor (OC) or secured or unsecured creditor, or the Corporate Debtor itself, to make \nan application before the Adjudicating Authority (AA) to initiate Corporate Insolvency Resolution \nProcess (CIRP) against a Corporate Debtor, at their discretion, in the event of there being a default by \nthe Corporate Debtor in payment of their dues for an amount as specified from time to time. On \ninitiation of the said CIRP, a resolution to be sought for the company withing a time bound time period \nof 180 days. \n \nMicro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 \nThe Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 was enacted in order to promote \nand enhance the competitiveness of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (“MSME”). As per the \nnotification no. F. No. 2/1(5)/2019-P&G/Policy (Pt.-IV) dated June 01, 2020, the Central Government \nnotified the following criteria for the classification of MSME with effect from July 01, 2020: as a micro-\nenterprise, where the investment in plant and machinery or equipment does not exceed One Crore \nRupees and turnover does not exceed Five Crore Rupees; a small enterprise, where the investment in \nplant and machinery or equipment does not exceed ten crore rupees and turnover does not exceed \nFifty Crore Rupees; and a medium enterprise, where the investment in plant and machinery or \nequipment does not exceed Fifty Crore Rupees and turnover does not exceed Two Hundred and Fifty \nCrore Rupees. Page 182 of 402 The classification limits for MSME have been revised pursuant to MSME Notification No. SO-1364(E) \ndated 21.03.2025. The new classification thresholds are as follows: (a) For Micro Enterprises, the \ninvestment limit will be raised to ₹ 2.5 crores and the turnover limit to ₹ 10 crores; (b) For Small \nEnterprises, the investment limit will be increased to ₹ 25 crores and the turnover limit to ₹ 100 crores; \nand (c) For Medium Enterprises, the investment limit will be enhanced to ₹ 125 crores and the turnover \nlimit to ₹ 500 crores. These revised limits have come into effect from 1 April 2025. \n \nThe Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 \nThe Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“A&C Act”) provides a framework for the resolution of \ndisputes through arbitration and conciliation. The main aim of A&C Act is to promote alternative \ndispute resolution mechanisms and offer cost-effective, and private alternative to court litigation. \nArbitration or conciliation is initiated based on an agreement between the parties or by a court order. \nIn arbitration proceedings the tribunal conducts hearings, gathers evidence, and issues an award based \non the proceedings. In conciliation proceedings, the conciliator engages with the parties to help them \nreach a mutually acceptable resolution. The arbitral award is the final decision of the arbitrator(s), \nwhich is binding on the parties. The arbitral award has the same force of decree as that the court \ndecree.  \n \nConsumer Protection Act, 2019 \nThe Consumer Protection Act, 2019 (“Consumer Act”), has repealed Consumer Protection Act, 1986 \nand provides for the protection of the interest of the consumers and the settlement of disputes raised \nby the consumers. The provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 have been made effective \nvide notification no. F. No. J-9/1/2020-CPU dated July 23, 2020, and notification no. F. No. J-9/1/2020-\nCPU dated July 15, 2020, as issued by the Central Government. The Consumer Act sets out a \nmechanism for consumers to file complaints against, inter alia, service providers in cases of \ndeficiencies in services, unfair or restrictive trade practices, and excessive pricing. A three-tier \nconsumer grievance redressal mechanism has been implemented pursuant to the Consumer Act, at \nthe national, state, and district levels. Further, the Consumer Act established a Central Consumer \nProtection Authority to promote, enforce, and protect the rights of consumers. If the allegations \nspecified in a complaint about the services provided are proved, the service provider can be directed \nto inter alia remove the deficiencies in the services in question, return to the complainant the charges \npaid by the complainant, and pay compensation, including punitive damages, for any loss or injury \nsuffered by the consumer. Non-compliance with the orders of the authorities may attract criminal \npenalties in the form of fines and/or imprisonment. \n \nCompetition Act, 2002  \nThe Competition Act, 2002 aims to anti-competitive practices that cause or are likely to cause an \nappreciable adverse effect on competition in the relevant market in India. The act deals with the \nprohibition of agreements and anti-competitive agreements. No enterprise or group shall abuse its \ndominant position in various circumstances as mentioned under the act. The prima facie duty of the \nCompetition Commission established under the act is to eliminate practices having adverse effects on \ncompetition, promote and sustain competition, protect the interests of the consumer, and ensure \nfreedom of trade. \n \nIndian Stamp Act, 1899  \nUnder the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 and other State specific stamp legislations (“Stamp Act”) stamp \nduty is payable on instruments evidencing a transfer or creation or extinguishment of any right, title \nor interest in immovable property and other instruments specified therein. Stamp duty must be paid \non all instruments specified under the Stamp Act at the rates specified in the schedules to the Stamp \nAct. The applicable rates for stamp duty on instruments chargeable with duty vary from state to state. \nInstruments chargeable to duty under the Stamp Act, which are not duly stamped are incapable of \nbeing admitted in court as evidence of the transaction contained therein and it also provides for \nimpounding of instruments that are not sufficiently stamped or not stamped at all. Page 183 of 402 The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881  \nIn India, the laws governing monetary instruments such as cheques are contained in the Negotiable \nInstruments Act, 1881 (“NI Act”). The NI Act provides effective legal provision to restrain persons from \nissuing cheques without having sufficient funds in their account and any stringent provision to punish \nthem in the event of such cheque not being honoured by their bankers and returned unpaid. Section \n138 of the NI Act creates statutory offence in the matter of dishonour of cheques on the ground of \ninsufficiency of funds in the account maintained by a person with the banker. \n \nLEGISLATIONS RELATING TO LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT \n \nEmployees State Insurance Act, 1948  \nEmployees State Insurance Act, 1948 (“ESI Act”) as amended, provides for certain benefits to \nemployees in case of sickness, maternity, and employment injury.

Our results of operations and financial conditions are affected by numerous factors \nincluding the following: \n \nAbility to expand the customer base and develop new products capabilities to meet evolving \npreferences and generate new sales. \nCustomer relationships are the core of our business. Our ability to grow our operations and increase \nsales depends upon the brand awareness of our products among the end consumers. We expect that \nour revenue growth will be primarily driven by the pace of adoption of our products by the end \nconsumers. This will drive demand for our products by the end consumers from switching from their \nregular brand to our brand.   \n \nWe have substantial opportunity to grow our customer base. We have invested, and intend to \ncontinue to invest, in order to drive sales to new customer. In particular, we have made, and plan to \ncontinue to make, investments to enhance the expertise of our sales and marketing segment. Our \nbusiness from existing customers has steadily grown and contributed a significant portion of our \nrevenue. Our ability to establish and strengthen customer relationships and expand the scope of our \nproducts and services will be an important factor in our future growth and our ability to continue \nincreasing our profitability. \n \nLeveraging on our present portfolio of customers and expertise in the verticals of our existing \ncustomers we aim to develop new customer relationships by identifying potential customers that \noperate within the same verticals as our existing customer. In addition, if we can generate healthy \ndemand for our products, we may be able to increase our price, which would consequently lead to an \nincrease in our revenues and profit margins. Conversely, if we are unable to provide products to our \ncustomers, either at all or at an acceptable price, or if our customers are dissatisfied with our product \nfor any other reason, it would have an adverse effect on our revenues and our profits. \n \nRegulatory Framework \nWe have obtained all regulatory permissions which are necessary to run our business, Further, some \nof the approvals are granted for fixed periods of time and need renewals, which are obtained in the \ncourse of business, however, there may be change in statutory regulations at any time which cannot \nbe predicted by us. There can be no assurance that the change in regulations will not impact our \noperations in the future. \n \nAbility of Management \nOur success depends on the continued services and performance of the members of our management \nteam and other key employees. Competition for senior management in the industry is intense, and \nwe may not be able to retain our existing senior management or attract and retain new senior \nmanagement in the future. The loss of the services of our Promoters could seriously impair our ability \nto continue to manage and expand our business. Further, the loss of any other member of our senior \nmanagement or other key personnel may adversely affect our business, results of operations and \nfinancial condition. Page 266 of 402 Ability to manage logistics and transportation needs \nWe rely on third party transportation and other logistic facilities at every stage of our business activity \nincluding for procurement of products from our suppliers and for transportation from our factory to \nour customers and other markets. Since the cost of our goods also carried by third party transporters \nis much higher than the consideration paid for transportation, it may be difficult for us to recover \ndamages for damaged, delayed or lost goods. Our operations and profitability are dependent upon \nthe availability of transportation and other logistic facilities in a time and cost-efficient manner. \nAccordingly, our business is vulnerable to increased transportation costs, transportation strikes and \nlock-outs, shortage of labour, delays and disruption of transportation services for events such as \nweather-related problems and accidents. Further, movement of goods encounters additional risks \nsuch as accidents, pilferage, spoilage or shrinkage may adversely affect our operations, results of \noperations and financial condition. Although we have not experienced any material logistics and \ntransport related disruptions in the past, any prolonged disruption or unavailability of such facilities \nin a timely manner could result in delays or non-supply or may require us to look for alternative \nsources which may not be cost-effective, thereby adversely affecting our operations, results of \noperations, cash flows and financial condition. \n \nMarket & Economic conditions \nIndia is one of the largest economies and is growing at a rapid pace. But in this globalised economy, \nall the businesses face an uncertain level of volatility from unexpected global events which ranges \nfrom global pandemics to wars, to weather changes to supply chain disruption, which may change the \neconomic dynamics and the purchasing capability of the end customer. At the time of market \nslowdown, the demand falls which has adverse impact on our business.  \n \nCompetition  \nWe operate in a competitive atmosphere. Our competition varies by market, geographic areas and \ntype of products. Our Company may face stiff competition from organized and unorganized players as \nthe dynamic changes. Some of our competitors may have greater resources than those available to \nus. While service quality, technical ability, performance records, etc. are key factors in client decisions \namong competitors, however, price and quality are the deciding factor in most cases. Further, this \nindustry is fragmented with many small and medium sized companies and entities, which \nmanufactures some of these products at various levels, which may adversely affect our business \noperation and financial condition. Further, there are no entry barriers in this industry and any \nexpansion in capacity of existing manufacturers would further intensify competition. Moreover, as we \nseek to diversify into new geographical areas, new territories, new emerging markets, we face \ncompetition from competitors that have a pan-India presence and also from competitors that have a \nstrong presence in regional markets. The markets in which we compete and intend to compete are \nundergoing, and are expected to continue to undergo, rapid and significant change. We expect \ncompetition to intensify as technological advances and consolidations continue. These competitive \nfactors may force us to reduce rates, and to pursue new market opportunities. Increased competition \ncould result in reduced demand for our products, increased expenses, reduced margins and loss of \nmarket share. Failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could harm our \nbusiness, operating cash flows and financial condition. \n \nChanges in fiscal, economic or political conditions in India \nWe are incorporated in India and we conduct our corporate affairs and our business from India. \nConsequently, our business operations, financial performance and the market price of our Equity \nShares are affected by interest rates, government policies, taxation, social and other political and \neconomic developments affecting India.  \n \nAny slowdown or perceived slowdown in the Indian economy, or in specific sectors of the Indian \neconomy or certain regions in India, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and \nfinancial condition along with the price of the Equity Shares. Page 267 of 402 For more information on these and other factors / development which have or may affect us, please \nrefer to chapters titled “Risk Factors”, “Our Industry” and “Our Business” beginning on page 32, 133 \nand 154 respectively. \n \nKEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND CERTAIN NON-GAAP MEASURES \n \nIn evaluating our business, we consider and use certain non-GAAP financial measures and key \nperformance indicators that are presented below as supplemental measures to review and assess our \noperating performance. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures and key performance \nindicators are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Restated Financial \nStatements. We present these non-GAAP financial measures and key performance indicators because \nthey are used by our management to evaluate our operating performance.

However, the rise is offset by decrease in loans from Banks/NBFCs \nshowcasing payment of the same. \n \nThe increase in the FY 2023 to FY 2025 is primarily attributed to the rise in secured loans from \nBanks/NBFCs, which increased from ₹ 258.62 Lakhs in FY24 to ₹ 841.87 Lakhs in FY25. Our company \navailed a Term Loan of ₹ 800.00 Lakhs from HDFC Bank at the end of FY 24 and majority of this loan \nwas disbursed during FY25. The loan was specifically availed for the purchase and installation of new \nplant and machinery, in line with our long-term expansion strategy driven by continuous growth in \nbusiness operations. \n \nFurther, increase of ₹ 194.48 Lakhs in long term borrowings as at 31.03.2024 is attributable to the rise \nof unsecured loans from Directors which increased from ₹ 240.10 lakhs as at 31.03.2023 to ₹ 389.18 \nLakhs as at 31.03.2024 which was repaid in FY25 resultantly unsecured loan from directors reduced \nto ₹ 249.43 lakhs in FY25. September 30, 2025 Page 270 of 402 Despite reduction in unsecured loan from directors in FY25, due to increase in loans from Banks, \noverall long-term borrowings increased from ₹647.80 Lakhs to ₹1091.30 Lakhs in FY25. \n \nShort term borrowings: Bifurcation of short-term borrowings is described below: (Amount in Lakhs) For the period \nended September For the fiscal year ended on March 31, Particulars 2025 \n2024 \n2023 30, 2025 Secured \n \n \n \n \nLoans from Banks/ NBFC \n3482.34 \n3458.20 \n1405.20 \n675.43 \nCurrent Maturity of Term Loan \n150.19 \n144.99 \n104.94 \n146.46 \nUnsecured \n \n \n \n \nFrom Directors \n- \n- \n- \n- \nLoans from Banks \n27.38 \n29.03 \n287.45 \n- \nTotal \n3,659.91 \n3,632.22 \n1,797.59 \n821.89 \n \nOur company’s short-term borrowings for the period ended on September 30, 2025 stood at ₹ \n3,659.91 lakhs reflecting a 0.76% increase from the amount outstanding as on March 31,2025. The \nslight increase is attributable to increase in working capital requirement. \n \nOur company’s short-term borrowings have increased from ₹ 821.89 lakhs as at 31.03.2023 to ₹ \n1,797.59 Lakhs as at 31.03.2024 and ₹ 3,632.22 Lakhs as at 31.03.2025. This increase in primarily \nattributed to increase in working capital limit. Our company’s sanctioned working capital limits \nincreased from ₹ 700 lakhs to ₹ 1740 lakhs during FY24 and further increased to ₹ 3,530 lakhs in FY25. \nThese limits were availed to fund the incremental working capital requirements of our company. For \ndetails, please refer “Objects of the Issue” beginning on page 101. \n \nTrade receivables/ payables:  \nOur trade receivables and payables have increased during the period ended on September 30, 2025 \nand for last 3 years from FY23 to FY25. For details, please refer “Objects of the issue” beginning on \npage 101. \n \nInventories:  \nFor increase in level of inventory for the period ended on September 30, 2025 and for FY23 to FY25, \nplease refer “Objects of the issue” beginning on page 101. \n \nOther Non-Current Assets \nOther non-current assets increased from ₹ 134.42 lakhs in FY 2025 to ₹ 147.07 lakhs for the period \nended on September 30, 2025. An increase from ₹ 18.81 Lakhs as at 31.03.2023 to ₹ 19.17 lakhs as at \n31.03.2024 and ₹ 134.42 Lakhs as at 31.03.2025. The main reason for such increase in FY25 is FDR of \n₹103.00Lakhs pledged with Banks in FY25 for availing working capital limit.  \n \nOVERVIEW OF REVENUE & EXPENDITURE \n \nRevenue and Expenses \nOur revenue and expenses are reported in the following manner: \n \nTotal Revenue \nOur Total Revenue comprises of revenue from operations and other income. ➢ Revenue from operations - Our revenue from operations comprises of sale of Ground Spices such as chilli powder, turmeric powder and coriander powder, Blended Spices such as garam masala, \ntea masala, sambhar masala etc., Whole Spices such as cumin seeds, fennel seeds, coriander \nwhole seed etc. and Other Grocery Products such as Black Salt, Rock Salt, Rice, Poha, Kasuri Methi \n(Dried Fenugreek) etc. and a diverse range of Herbs and seasonings which includes Organo, Peri \nPeri, Chilli Flakes, Mixed Herbs, Onion Flakes, Tomato Powder etc. Page 271 of 402 ➢ Other Income - Our other income principally includes interest income, rent income, gain on foreign exchange fluctuations and gain on sale of fixed assets if any.

The major part of the related party sale is made to Shyam Dhani Industries \n(Proprietorship firm of our Promoter Mr. Ramawtar Agarwal, hereinafter referred to as “Firm”). \nInitially, Shyam Dhani Industries was registered as an approved vendor with several major grocery \nplatforms, including Avenue Super Mart Ltd (D-Mart), Reliance Retail Ltd, Aadhar Wholesale Trading \n& Distribution Ltd and Metro Cash and Carry India Ltd. The firm purchased products from us to sell on \nthese platforms, as it was approved to distribute our products. \n \nIn FY 2024 and FY 2025, our company registered directly with all the major grocery platforms, and as \npart of this transition, the promoter decided to discontinue operations under the Shyam Dhani \nIndustries firm.

In FY25, the yield of the company stands at 96.10%, \nwhich is higher in comparison to 92.68% yield in FY24. This higher yield means higher amount of raw \nmaterial was converted into finished goods indicating efficient utilisation of resources and reducing \nthe overall wastage in the company. Due to higher output and lower wastage, the cost of production \nreduced thereby increasing the gross margins, ultimately increasing the PAT margins of the company. \n \nCOMPARISION OF RESTATED FINANCIALS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2024, WITH FINANCIAL \nYEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023 \n \nTotal Revenue: (Amount in Lakhs) \n2023-24 \n             2022-23 \nVariance in % \n10,763.63 \n6,810.27 \n58.05% \n \nOur total revenue has increased by 58.05% to ₹ 10,763.63 Lakhs for fiscal 2024 from ₹ 6,810.27 Lakhs \nfor fiscal 2023 bifurcated into revenue from operations and other income. \n \nRevenue from Operations (Amount in Lakhs) \n2023-24 \n 2022-23 \nVariance in % \n10,760.52 \n6,795.29 \n58.35% \n \nRevenue from Operations has increased by 58.35% to ₹ 10,760.52 Lakhs for fiscal 2024 from ₹ 6,795.29 \nLakhs for fiscal 2023.  \n                                                 \nRational for increase in revenue from operations by 58.35%                        \nOur company operates under a multi-level revenue model, which includes General Trade, Modern \nTrade, HORECA sales, Private Labelling, Quick Commerce, Exports, and Website sales.

This \n115.56% rise in PAT is due to 58.35% increase in sale turnover of our company in FY24. The reasons \nfor the increase in revenue is explained on page 281-285 in section “Comparison of restated financials \nfor the year ended on March 31, 2024 with financial year ended on March 31, 2023” in the chapter \ntitled “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”. \nFurther this rise in revenue from operations lead in increase in our gross margins from ₹ 1,270.61 in \nFY 23 to ₹ 2,001.61 lakhs in FY 24. The additional gross margin amounting to ₹ 731.00 lakhs generated \nin FY24 resulted in increase of PAT of our company from ₹ 292.40 lakhs to ₹ 630.29 lakhs due to the \nfact that fixed costs of our company do not increase in proportion to rise in gross margins in absolute \nterms.

Our approach to \nmanaging liquidity is to ensure to the extent possible, that we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our \nliabilities when they are due under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring \nunacceptable losses or risking damage to our reputation. We manage liquidity risk by maintaining \nadequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring \nforecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. \n \nEffect of Inflation \nWe are affected by inflation as it has an impact on the raw material cost, wages, etc. In line with \nchanging inflation rates, we rework our margins to absorb the inflationary impact. \n \nCredit Risk \nWe are exposed to credit risk on monies owed to us by our customers If our customers do not pay us \npromptly, or at all, we may have to make provisions for or write off such amounts. \n \nReservations, qualifications and adverse remarks \nExcept as disclosed in chapter titled “Financial Statements as Restated” beginning on page 220, there \nhave been no reservations, qualifications and adverse remarks. \n \nDetails of default, if any, including therein the amount involved, duration of default and present \nstatus, in repayment of statutory dues or repayment of debentures or repayment of deposits or \nrepayment of loans from any bank or financial institution. \nExcept as disclosed in chapter titled “Financial Statements as Restated” beginning on page 220, there \nhave been no defaults in payment of statutory dues or repayment of debentures and interest thereon \nor repayment of deposits and interest thereon or repayment of loans from any bank or financial \ninstitution and interest thereon by the Company. \n \nMaterial Frauds \nThere are no material frauds, as reported by our statutory auditor, committed against our Company, \nin the last three Fiscals. \n \nUnusual or infrequent events or transactions \nExcept as described in this Red Herring Prospectus, during the years under review there have been no \ntransactions or events, which in our best judgment, would be considered unusual or infrequent. \n \nSignificant economic changes that materially affected or are likely to affect income from continuing \noperations. \nIndian rules and regulations as well as the overall growth of Indian economy have a significant bearing Page 288 of 402 on our operations.

Everest alleged trademark \ninfringement through the sale of the Company’s product “SHYAM TIKHA LAL” and claimed \n₹ 5 crore in damages or profits earned from the infringing sales, along with the delivery and \ndestruction of all products containing ‘TIKHALAL’. In response, our Company contended \nthat ‘SHYAM TIKHA LAL’ has been in continuous use since 1995 and was registered in 2015, \narguing that ‘TIKHA’ and ‘LAL’ are common descriptive Hindi words that cannot be \nmonopolized. The Company denied any infringement or passing off, asserting that the \nmarks are distinct and unlikely to cause consumer confusion. The matter is currently \npending adjudication. \n \nAdditionally, Everest Food Products Pvt.

Pursuant to the SEBI UPI Circulars, the UPI mechanism has been introduced in \na phased manner as a payment mechanism (in addition to mechanism of blocking funds in the account \nmaintained with SCSBs under the ASBA) for Bids by UPI Bidders through designated intermediaries \nwith the objective to reduce the time duration from public issue closure to listing from six Working \nDays to up to three Working Days. Considering the time required for making necessary changes to the \nsystems and to ensure complete and smooth transition to the UPI payment Mechanism, the SEBI UPI \nCircular have introduced the UPI Mechanism in three phases in the following manner: \n \n• \nPhase I: This phase was applicable from January 1, 2019 until March 31, 2019 or floating of five \nmain board public issues, whichever was later. Subsequently, the timeline for implementation of \nPhase I was extended till June 30, 2019. Under this phase, a Individual Bidder had the option to \nsubmit the ASBA Form with any of the designated intermediaries and use his / her UPI ID for the \npurpose of blocking of funds. The time duration from public issue closure to listing continue to be \nsix Working Days. \n \n• \nPhase II: This phase has become applicable from July 1, 2019 and was to initially continue for a \nperiod of three months or floating of five main board public issues, whichever is later. SEBI, vide \nits circular no. SEBI/HO/CFD/DCR2/CIR/P/2019/133 dated November 8, 2019 has decided to \nextend the timeline for implementation of UPI Phase II until March 31, 2020. Subsequently, SEBI, \nvide its circular no. SEBI/HO/CFD/DIL2/CIR/P/2020/50 dated March 30, 2020 extended the \ntimeline for implementation of UPI Phase II till further notice. Under this phase, submission of the \nASBA Form by UPI Bidders through Designated Intermediaries (other than SCSBs) to SCSBs for \nblocking of funds has been discontinued and replaced by the UPI Mechanism. However, the time \nduration from public issue closure to listing continues to be six Working Days during this phase. • \nPhase III:  This phase has become applicable on a voluntary basis for all issues opening on or after \nSeptember 1, 2023, and on a mandatory basis for all issues opening on or after December 1, 2023, \nvide SEBI circular bearing number SEBI/HO/CFD/TPD1/CIR/P/2023/140 dated August 9, 2023 \n(\"T+3 Notification”). In this phase, the time duration from public issue closure to listing has been \nreduced to three Working Days. The Issue shall be undertaken pursuant to the processes and \nprocedures as notified in the T+3 Notification as applicable, subject to any circulars, clarification \nor notification issued by the SEBI from time to time, including any circular, clarification or \nnotification which may be issued by SEBI.
